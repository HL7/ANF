                        a Terminology Knowledge layer concern, not a Statement Layer concern. The
                        Statement Layer does require that the Terminology Expression fields in a
                        statement are disjoint: There should be no confusion—or creation of false
                        dichotomies. There should be one, and only one, place to put each type of
                        information in a terminology expression. For example, the Statement Layer
                        defines a particular place to represent the subject of information.
                        Therefore, the terminology layer must not allow the subject of information
                        to be redundantly—and possibly contradictory—represented in a topic
                        expression (such as would be the case if "maternal history of diabetes"
                        where an allowed topic expression). The Statement Layer requires that the
                        topic represent an Action as a code or expression according to the rules of
                        the terminology layer, and that the rules of the terminology layer enforce a
                        disjointness of between different types of terminology expressions. Here we
                        present a starting point for what the Terminology Layer editorial rules may
                        look like, based on current SNOMED CT practice. </para>

                    <para>SNOMED CT can accommodate this requirement for simple observations by
                        using Observation procedure to represent the topic (or other types of
                        procedures when appropriate, such as the administration of a medication). In
                        SNOMED CT examples, the Observation procedure specifies a Has focus
                        attribute linking it to the Clinical Finding or Disorder that it is being
                        observed. The observation procedure can also be further refined by adding
                        attributes in the terminology model, including Method, Procedure site -
                        Direct, (if appropriate) Laterality, and Using device.

                        activity that is performed at the same time even though a Lumbar CT and a
