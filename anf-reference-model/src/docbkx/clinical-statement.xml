This comment is written after I made other comments on assertions in section 1.6.10. Although I get, I think, the gist, this entire section – and actually the entire larger section 1.6 – is unclear because of insufficient distinction between what is description and what the description is about. Section 1.6’s title is ‘clinical statement components’ and the impression is given that the components are listed one by one in the subsections. The main problem I have is that there is not explicit enough distinction between what is on the side of the patient – e.g. a tumor – and what is on the side of documentation thereof, i.e. what a clinical statement should be, f.i. ‘observation of tumor’, ‘removal of tumor’, … Now are ‘clinical statement components’ strictly components of descriptions or does it include components of the patient itself? If it is only on the side of the description, is it to be taken as a literal part of the description, does it include implicit components that are identified in certain linguistic theories about term formation (e.g. case grammar, case theory, …). Most essential to get clear is what ‘topic’ exactly stands for.

But surely you should disambiguate between the phenomena themselves and the observations thereof. Plus be more precise about what ‘observation’ exactly is, otherwise you get trapped in HL7-nonsense. Clearly, you can only observe phenomena that are there: you can only observe congestive heart failure in a patient when it is there. But you can state in a record that the patient has CHF without he having it. In such case, the clinician might believe he observed an instance of CHF, but he did not observe it. Furthermore, ‘observe’ should not be overloaded with ‘deduce’. You can’t observe ‘psychosis’, only deduce it on the basis of …

Brings in another level of confusion: I thought this entire discussion was about documenting what is on the side of the patient, here you include documenting how clinical statements are configured. That might be valid too, and I would even recommend it for quality control purposes, but then an extra meta-level needs to be included.

        <title>statementAssociation</title>
        <para>statementAssociation enables the clinical statement to link to other clinical
            statements. They are part of the narrative but are not considered part of the topic.
            They can further specify, e.g. instructions that apply to the performance of an action.
            If the topic is a laboratory result panel, each association would point to another
            statement which is a laboratory result.</para><?oxy_comment_end?>
