    <para>There are two fundamental differences between the ANF and CIF approach. The first is the
        representation of topic, and the second is the representation of results.</para>

        <title>The Representation of Topic</title>
        <para>In the ANF model, the topic is represented by a single field containing a simple to
            complex expression using codeable concepts, whereas in the CIF model, all the pieces of
            information that make up the topic are broken out and structured as needed into multiple
            properties with property names and appropriate datatypes.</para>

            </figure>
        </para>
        <para>One implication of this is that the ANF is using two formalisms to represent the
            detailed clinical model. First it uses the formalism that represents the ANF reference
            model and constraints such as HL7's StructureDefinition syntax or OpenEHR's BMM/ADL
            syntax. Second, it uses SNOMED's syntax for post co-ordinated SNOMED expressions. Tools
            for authoring and analysis would be required to parse and process both syntaxes.</para>
        <para>The CIF model, on the other hand, would be fully represented using the formalism that
            represents the CIF reference model and constraints such as HL7's StructureDefinition
            syntax or OpenEHR's BMM/ADL syntax.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>The Representation of Results</title>
        <para>In the CIMI CIF model, EvaluationResult and Assertion models are used to represent
            results. Evaluation- Result has a topic representing what is being observed, and a
            result represented by a choice of datatypes. An Assertion on the other hand, has simply
            a topic with a value of 'assertion', and a result stated what is being asserted.</para>
        <para>In the ANF model, the topic represents what is being observed and the result may only
            be a range of either a count or quantity. No coded results are allowed.</para>
        <para>In the CIF model, when creating a model with a numeric result, the choice is quite
            clear, and the choice will be an EvaluationResult, such as a topic of 'SerumSodium' and
            result with a numeric quantity. In this case, the CIF and ANF model are very aligned,
            except for the fact that the ANF model will use a range of that quantity.</para>
        <para>But when a CIF model has a potential coded result, the choice between EvaluationResult
            and Assertion becomes muddied. For example, a model for Breath Sound could be an
            EvaluationResult with a topic of 'breath sound' and a coded result with the following
            valueset. Thus, any of the breath sounds within the valueset can act as a result for
            this model. The other option, is that each of the breath sounds in the valueset is
            modeled as an Assertion with a topic of 'assertion', and a result of each particular
            code. To decided which model is better, usually we ponder how the clinician thinks about
            the data, or how it will be collected, or how it will be queried.</para>
        <para>The ANF model cannot do an EvaluationResult style model as it doesn't allow coded
            results. Thus, ANF is forced to make one and only one choice, which is an assertion
            style where the particular breath sound is the topic, and the result will be numeric
            count indicating presence or absence.</para>

        <para>When querying instance data, the Assertion or ANF style is much more difficult for
            things like breath sounds. To query any breath sound instances, you must have knowledge
            of all possible breath sound topics and query for each. With the EvaluationResult style,
            querying is simpler as you simply query for a topic of 'breath sound', and the code
            result tells you what type of breath sound it is. Thus, you do not have to know all the
            members of the valueset apriori to form the query. Clinical
