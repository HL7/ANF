This is too imprecise:
1) ‘structured’ according to what? Sentences are also structured, some according to English grammar, others according to a grammar for technical sublanguage (see Naomi Sager’s Linguistic String project).
2) ‘computable’ by whom or what? Some algorithms can, others can’t.
3) ‘A clinical statement REPRESENTS and entry in the patient record’: do you mean (a) ‘is’ an entry, such that if x is an instance of Clinical Statement, then x is also an instance of Entry in a Patient Record, or (b) if x is instance of Clinical Statement, then there is some y instance of Entry in the Patient record such that x represents y, or (c) the ‘documents’ restricts the scope of what record entries qualify as clinical statements, namely those that document clinical information?
4) ‘Clinical Information’? this extends the previous issue: is this a third thing z instance of Clinical Information such that x represents y and y documents z? I would argue that clinical statements and clinical information under whatever interpretation.

An Entry is a Clinical Statement, and a Clinical Statement is an Entry.   In the case of 13606, Entry has a defined data structure and instances which conform to constraints applied to this data structure.  Clinical Statement has a defined data structure and instances which conform to constraints applied to this data structure. 

Anyway, maybe the following for the first paragraph which avoids all the comments above.

A Clinical Statement is a complete description about a particular aspect, characteristic, or condition of a patient.  The ANF Model attempts to define a data structure to represent these clinical statements in a reproducible and computable manner.
" parentID="ddb_byf_nhb"?>statement
        represents an entry in the patient record that documents, in a structured/computable manner,
        clinical information related to the patient that is asserted by a particular source,
        recorded, and potentially verified. <?oxy_comment_end?><?oxy_comment_end mid="1"?>
    </para>
    <para>As seen in the Clinical Statements section, clinical information related to the patient
        can be entered and stored in an EMR in multiple different formats. ANF strives to
        standardize the structure of clinical statements to eliminate the complexity of the clinical
        information due to the ability of EMR implementers having multiple ways of presenting input.
        By structuring the clinical statement and transforming the multiple differing
        representations into the appropriate ANF clinical statement, clinical information becomes
        more easily computable.  Transforming the clinical input into the ANF structure eliminates
        the need to create multiple ways to analyze the same data.</para>

Such family history is clinically relevant but is not a characteristic of the patient. I suggest to make this a 3rd type of clinical statement. If you insist on classifying statements based on what they are about, then you would have (1) statements which describe the patient as a whole, any part of him, or any entities that depend on him or his parts (qualities, realizables, processes in which he or his parts participate); (2) statements about requests for actions that once executed will results in statements of type 1 or type 3, and (3) statements about clinically relevant phenomena that occurred or have occurred in his environment but are not about the patient himself.

I think it would be valuable if we could show how ANF can improve the precision of “clinical statements”.
Both C-CDA and FHIR US core specify profiles intended to represent data captured by EHRs. If we could show how an EHR-produced “result” could be represented in ANF.
We could propose this improvement to Orders&amp;Observations, Patient Care, and Clinical Decision Support work groups.

            <para>The representation of clinical data across disparate healthcare organizations is
                highly variable; due to the various networks, communication channels, set of
                transformations, and different organizations of clinical data that currently exist.
                Despite the fact that there are mandated and widely implemented clinical terminology
                standards, standardized representation of clinical data is non-trivial because each
                standard has different semantics models, and use different formalisms and tools for
                their representation, have separate release cycles, and different versioning
                mechanisms. These terminologies are often used in an inconsistent way across
                implementations of the same underlying systems, and the minimal integration of
                systems such as SNOMED CT and LOINC and RxNorm is an area requiring considerable
                attention if we want to support safe and effective portability of software
                components and the ability to reuse code across healthcare organizations. </para>
            <para>One implementation of a decision support alert of quality measure query at the
                Veterans Health Administration, for instance, is not completely transferrable to
                another institution; analysts at each organization will have to modify the
                underlying query which might be in Structured Query Language (SQL) for instance so
                that it is computable against their respective clinical database structure.
                Furthermore, all of the standards-based encoded concepts are not recorded in the
                same way in different EHR implementations; what may be structured in one system and
                represented by LOINC may be represented in another system by SNOMED Ct, and yet
                another system may represent the concepts using free text.</para>
            <para>The standardization of clinical observations in a manner that supports automated
                processing requires a formal terminology model. The most important requirements of
                such a terminology model are that (1) it can represent any clinician-specified
                observation accurately and precisely and (2) it can support automated query and
                retrieval operations correctly and efficiently.</para>
            <para>Importantly, ANF supports the ability to express new medical concepts by combining
                pre-existing ones. This process, called post-coordination, enables clinicians who
                use SCT to express observations that do not appear as pre-defined concepts in the
                terminology, thereby vastly increasing the expressive power of clinical
                terminologies. For example, a clinician could document that a patient has “bacterial
                pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staph. Aureus” by combining the
                pre-existing concept “bacterial pneumonia” with the pre-existing concept
                “Methicillin Resistant Staph. Aureus” and specifying that the latter is the
                “causative agent” of the former. The patient’s medical record would then contain an
                entry consisting of the following expression: </para>
            <para>Bacterial Pneumonia (ConceptID = 53084003) : Causative Agent (ConceptID=246075003)
                = Methicillin Resistant Staph. Aureus (ConceptID=115329001)</para>
            <para>If specified correctly, post-coordinated expressions also support subsumption
                testing. Hence, the patient whose record contains the expression above would also be
                identified by the query “find all patients with a diagnosis of any infectious
                disease (Infectious Disease : ConceptID = 40733004) in their record.”</para>
            <para>Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of
                relations. Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation
                anomalies. So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations. Normal forms are
                used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables.</para>

            <para>If a relation contain composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates first
                normal form or a relation is in first normal form if it does not contain any
                composite or multi-valued attribute. A relation is in first normal form if every
                attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">2. Second Normal Form</emphasis></para>
            <para>To be in second normal form, a relation must be in first normal form and relation
                must not contain any partial dependency. A relation is in 2NF iff it has No Partial
                Dependency, i.e., no non-prime attribute (attributes which are not part of any
                candidate key) is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the
                table.</para>

        <para> "Increasingly, the hypothesis is uttered that data from an EHR can be reused for
            other purposes, such as continuity of care and decision support on the individual level,
            and quality measurement, management of healthcare institutions, epidemiology, among
            other purposes for secondary data use, based on comparison of populations and healthcare
            systems. Such hypothesis can only be confirmed if certain conditions are met. One sine
            qua non condition is adherence to privacy regulations and data security measures. That
            is assumed here, but not explored further. Another assumption is that the data to be
            aggregated are comparable indeed. That is the driving assumption for this standard,
            because it does require preciseness in meaning and in use in applications. The third
            assumption is that each purpose on an aggregate level requires its own context to be
            taken into account for valid and reliable decision making. In particular, algorithms,
            calculations for proper data handling, but also potential influencing factors. For
            management data management from EHR for instance, one needs to have knowledge on the
            architecture of the building in which care takes place, the workforce and so on. If data
            are interpreted for quality measurement, one needs to be aware of case-mix and
            regulations to interpret scores properly. For epidemiology, the characteristics of the
            population are core for proper interpretation of study data.</para>
        <para> All purposes, both on clinical and aggregate levels, have in common that the
            semantics, the context, the care process, and the use in decision making determine how
            data are collected, stored, managed in an EHR and communicated.</para>
        <para>Healthcare is used to classifications and terminologies to help in purposes of data
            collection. To a large extend, classifications can be seen as mainly developed for the
            aggregate purposes, and terminologies for clinical data in the EHR. However, these
            functions are more and more overlapping. Similarly, we see assessment sheets for
            clinical practice and registry forms, like minimum data sets, for the data collection.
            We also see that information modeling is applied as tool to organize data in healthcare
            information technology in general, and the EHR in particular. Two core examples are the
            Health Level Seven Reference Information Model , and the IS 13606-1 reference
            information model for the Electronic Health Record.</para>
        <para> The underlying assumption for this standard on Detailed Clinical Models is that to
            use, exchange and reuse data, and to obtain meaningful information from it for each
            purpose, data need to be handled consistently. This consistent use is required on both
            the mono and multidisciplinary health professional level. But of course, consistency is
            not only necessary at the human level, but also at systems level such as the EHR itself,
            data exchange for continuity of care, and data warehouses or registries where the
            aggregated data are stored."</para>

        <para>"In the early nineties, a group of smart scientists in the area of health informatics
            invented an approach to the development of EHRs which was called two level modeling
                [<link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141130/#B4"
                >4</link>]. In this approach, the generic functions of record systems, such as
            entering, storing, presenting, managing, communicating, and adding generic data, such as
            patient name and ID, location, time, professional (e.g., through the login), where
            separated out from the clinical details. And, these clinical details can be millions,
            and only need specific descriptions to distinguish these from each other. <link

        <para>  With the DCM approach the benefits of the two level modeling are respected and the
            enormous efforts that went into the clinical modeling efforts are also acknowledged. The
            idea dates back to 2007 where during a workshop, an overarching approach called Detailed
            Clinical Modeling emerged, using a term from Huff et al. [<link
                xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141130/#B1">1</link>].
            This approach takes the commonalties of the various specifications to keep the
            conceptual descriptions and the logical models of data elements, code binding,
            relationships, data type specifications and such [<link
                xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141130/#B9">9</link>].
            However, it does not go to the level of physical specification, and even, the logical
            model can easily be converted to reference model based approaches as Health Level 7
            Reference Information Model (HL7 RIM) or OpenEHR or reference models.</para>
        <para> Due to the interoperability issues among these clinical modeling approaches and the
            investments already made, there currently is an approach trying to harmonize the
            existing work. This is carried out by the Clinical Information Modeling Initiative
            (CIMI). Their goal is to create a harmonized reference model for clinical knowledge
            models using both the ADL and UML formalisms. From these baseline formats, any kind of
            technical artifact can potentially be derived. CIMI also works on an EHR clinical model
            repository as open content. However, in practice, with all good intentions, CIMI has
            created yet another reference model and yet another dialect of ADL. Nevertheless, other
            initiatives seem to start picking these harmonization results up.</para>

            just for the illustration of the commonalties and differences. An example DCM is
