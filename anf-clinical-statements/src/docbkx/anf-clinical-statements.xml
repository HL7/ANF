This is too imprecise:
1) ‘structured’ according to what? Sentences are also structured, some according to English grammar, others according to a grammar for technical sublanguage (see Naomi Sager’s Linguistic String project).
2) ‘computable’ by whom or what? Some algorithms can, others can’t.
3) ‘A clinical statement REPRESENTS and entry in the patient record’: do you mean (a) ‘is’ an entry, such that if x is an instance of Clinical Statement, then x is also an instance of Entry in a Patient Record, or (b) if x is instance of Clinical Statement, then there is some y instance of Entry in the Patient record such that x represents y, or (c) the ‘documents’ restricts the scope of what record entries qualify as clinical statements, namely those that document clinical information?
4) ‘Clinical Information’? this extends the previous issue: is this a third thing z instance of Clinical Information such that x represents y and y documents z? I would argue that clinical statements and clinical information under whatever interpretation.

An Entry is a Clinical Statement, and a Clinical Statement is an Entry.   In the case of 13606, Entry has a defined data structure and instances which conform to constraints applied to this data structure.  Clinical Statement has a defined data structure and instances which conform to constraints applied to this data structure. 

Anyway, maybe the following for the first paragraph which avoids all the comments above.

A Clinical Statement is a complete description about a particular aspect, characteristic, or condition of a patient.  The ANF Model attempts to define a data structure to represent these clinical statements in a reproducible and computable manner.

As expected, it goes already wrong here: surely requesting something is an action that is performed, and the result might be that the request is accepted or denied.

Such family history is clinically relevant but is not a characteristic of the patient. I suggest to make this a 3rd type of clinical statement. If you insist on classifying statements based on what they are about, then you would have (1) statements which describe the patient as a whole, any part of him, or any entities that depend on him or his parts (qualities, realizables, processes in which he or his parts participate); (2) statements about requests for actions that once executed will results in statements of type 1 or type 3, and (3) statements about clinically relevant phenomena that occurred or have occurred in his environment but are not about the patient himself.

                clinician. Most of the times, but not always, the object of the request (e.g., lab
                test, medication order) will be fulfilled by someone other than the clinician (e.g.,
                lab technician, pharmacist) making the request. All information about the request
                will be documented in this clinical statement, including information about details
                relating to the request, such as patient must fast for 12 hours before having a

I think it would be valuable if we could show how ANF can improve the precision of “clinical statements”.
Both C-CDA and FHIR US core specify profiles intended to represent data captured by EHRs. If we could show how an EHR-produced “result” could be represented in ANF.
We could propose this improvement to Orders&amp;Observations, Patient Care, and Clinical Decision Support work groups.
