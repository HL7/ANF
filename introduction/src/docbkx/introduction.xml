  <title>Why Analysis Normal Form? A Normal Form for Clinical Statements</title>
  <para>A <glossterm baseform="Clinical Statement">clinical statement</glossterm> is a definite and
    clear representation of a clinically-significant fact or situation was observed to exist or to
    have happened, or that a particular procedure was requested. A clinical statement can be
    expressed as a <glossterm baseform="Statement Narrative">narrative</glossterm> that provides a
    written account that can be naturally read by humans, as well as a <glossterm
      baseform="Normal Form">normal form</glossterm> which is a machine-processable representation
    of the statement's data as a standardized and encoded fundamental form. Today, clinical
    statements are often represented in unpredictable and denormalized forms, which makes reliable
    and safe decision support challenging, and reduces the quality of other types of data
    processing. </para>

    standards-based clinical statements<!--a substantial number of extant EHR mapped data sets--> to
    improve the health of the population (or citizenry) through quality measures, case reporting,
    and decision support. The ability to measure and improve outcomes relies on consistent,

      systems record and manage clinical statements using a variety of standard or ad-hoc models.
      However, both treatment and analysis of clinical statements require consistency not only at
      the format level (e.g. <glossterm>CDA</glossterm>, FHIR, V2) but also the content model (i.e.
      an instance of an <link xlink:href="https://www.iso.org/standard/62416.html"><glossterm

      obstacle to analysis, but even in the case of structured, semantically-clear information,
      inconsistency across sources of information raises obstacles to analysis. Analysis of

      today because a meaningful use of data for patient outcomes or research requires a common

      only is there a potential for a lack of consistency with representing clinical statements with
      current <glossterm baseform="Detailed Clinical Model">detailed clinical modeling</glossterm>
      efforts, but there is also further variation in how the data are entered into information
      systems by end-users. This reality has a direct impact on patient safety if a clinical
      statement is recorded and displayed differently across the continuum of care. Clinicians
      author clinical statements and enter them into their organization’s EHR systems where they are
      represented as some type of <glossterm baseform="Structured Clinical Input Forms">"Clinical
        Input Form"</glossterm> (CIF). This concept describes the representation of any natural
      language processing or data entry mechanism used by clinicians to record clinical statements.
      Vendors may compete on usability which may result in proprietary CIF data, or, clinical
      statements are based on standards-based models (e.g. CIMI, openEHR archetypes). For the
      purposes of this document, the type or usability of CIF data structures are not in scope. We
      assume that <emphasis role="bold">any suitably encoded</emphasis> clinical statement may be
      normalized. <?oxy_comment_end?></para>
    <para>Ideally, clinical information is modeled in a manner that is most efficient for use. This
      is a problem because there are many different use cases for clinical information with a wide
      range of requirements. There is no single model that can be the most efficient model for all
      the various use cases. Maximum efficiency for each use case necessitates that any particular
      clinical information be available in multiple modeled forms. These models, although different
      in form, semantically represent the same information, and are known as <glossterm
        baseform="Isosemantic Model">isosemantic models</glossterm>. Any particular detailed
      clinical model exists within a family of isosemantic siblings. </para>
    <para>Clinical statements can be expressed and documented in many different ways in EHR systems,
      where clinical input forms provide different options to document the same clinical statement.
      These differences pose challenges for how the data are modeled and stored, and therefore have
      implications on data retrieval, data analysis, and accuracy of clinical analysis results. </para>

        require not only objective quantitative measurements (e.g. 90 beats per minute for a

        about past observations or requests for future interventions. While two quantitative
        measurements may be the same, the procedural information could indicate meaningful semantic
        differences and lead to different clinical interpretation and treatment. As information is
        exchanged across systems, the solution requires a common understanding of data and a method
        to support knowledge-representation and clinical decision rules based on common terminology
        and statements. Each component must address an aspect and, together they need to address the

    <title>Background: HL7 Clinical Statement Standards</title>
    <para>Clinical statement standardization has been a long-standing concern for HL7 and reuse of
      these content models across paradigms (e.g. messages, documents, services). Standardization
      has relied on model-driven approaches requiring a separation of concerns along with
      conceptual, logical, and implementation perspectives.</para>
    <para>HL7 Service-Aware Interoperability Framework (SAIF) organizes HL7 standards along three
      perspectives (i.e. conceptual, logical, and implementable). </para>
    <section>
      <title>HL7 Service-Aware Interoperability Framework (SAIF)</title>
      <para>To augment the HL7 Version 2 and Version 3 representations, HL7 introduced an
        architecture to allow for a clear separation of concerns among interoperability models and
        specifications from the abstract or conceptual to the most precise, implementable, and
        testable that ensures semantic interoperability. This architecture is the HL7 Service-Aware
        Interoperability Framework Canonical Definition (SAIF-CD).<link linkend="bib6"
        >[9]</link></para>
      <para>The SAIF-CD specification <link linkend="bib6">[9]</link> defines three SAIF
        Perspectives: Conceptual, Logical, and Implementable. These perspectives are not formally
        equivalent with <glossterm baseform="Object Management Group">Object Management Group’s

        (MDA)</glossterm><?oxy_comment_end?> even though it reuses the same derivation. Therefore,
        the Implementable Perspective is derived from the Logical Perspective and the Logical
        Perspective is derived from the Conceptual Perspective. This approach ensures that any
        implementable artifacts (i.e. service specifications, implementation guides) are traceable
        to business/clinical requirements and logical models of knowledge.</para>

      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Logical Perspective</title>
        <para>Artifacts in the Logical Perspective represent traceable translations of

          “inward-facing analysts.” Also included are additional specification materials required by
          architects preparing artifacts for consumption by developers. The Logical Perspective
          contains platform-independent artifacts.</para>
        <para>There are no definite boundaries between the Logical and Implementable Perspectives.
          Therefore, it is important for organizations such as HL7 to standardize logical models
          used to generate/create implementable artifacts (i.e. implementation guides, profiles, and
          templates). <glossterm baseform="CIMI Clinical Statement">CIMI Clinical

          perspective.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Implementable Perspective</title>
        <para>Artifacts in the Implementable Perspective are typically defined by developers or
          standards implementers, often through discussion with software designers, architects, or
          system integrators. Note that the artifacts in the Implementable Perspective are not
          actual implementations, but rather implementable in a number of implementation instances.
          Thus, all the necessary technical bindings, including data types, value sets, class
          libraries, and interface specifications are part of the Implementable Perspective. FHIR
          implementation requires a combination of profiles and test cases to ensure that
          implementations meet the requirements used to derive the conceptual and logical
          models.</para>

      <para>The V3 Clinical Statement Model is applied across CDA implementation guides including
        the US-Realm Consolidated CDA (C-CDA) to represent CDA document entries. A V3 Clinical
        Statement Model is a <glossterm baseform="Polymorphic model">polymorphic model</glossterm>:
        it can represent observations, procedures, encounters, public health reports, supply,
        medications, exposure, and derivations of clinical acts. The V3 Clinical Statement model
        provides a Statement Model with partial Terminology constraints. For example, Clinical
        Statements in a CDA document section need to be constrained to add the precision needed to
        support the Terminology Knowledge layer. CDA entry and sub-entry templates can be used to
        create precise implementations of the V3 Clinical Statement model for a specific type of
        clinical statement (e.g. Procedure Activity, Problem Observation) sharing a common statement
        model but different terminology and usage constraints. The US-Realm C-CDA specification
        consists of a set of templates that constrain the document, sections, and entries used in
        each section. </para>

      <para>ANF is intended for projects that aggregate clinical statements from a variety of
        sources, independent of formalism or approach used by the source system. It normalizes
        approaches and methodologies in use across the industry and provide a uniform representation
        of data to enable analysis in a platform-independent view using context-free languages. ANF
        underscores that both treatment and analysis of clinical statements require consistency not
        only at the format level (e.g. CDA, FHIR, V2) but also the content model (i.e. an instance
        of an ISO/TS 13972 DCM, CIMI model, etc.). Context-free languages offer a high level of
        expressivity and formalization, thus enabling the representation of any real-world artifact.
        ANF can be applied to real world business systems using platform-specific representations
        (e.g. FHIR profiles and resources, database schema definitions) Those representations may be
        derived from the ANF Reference Model. Like other standards for defining and managing
        clinical statements such as <link xlink:href="https://www.iso.org/standard/67868.html">ISO
          13606 EHR Communication</link> or <link
          xlink:href="https://www.iso.org/standard/62416.html">ISO 13972 Clinical Information
          Models,</link> ANF may be extended by the <link
          xlink:href="https://www.iso.org/standard/77337.html">ISO 23903 Interoperability and
          Integration Reference Architecture</link> to enable the justification of correctness and
        consistency of the content models and their relationships.</para>
      <para>Different use cases usually represent different contexts, frequently not reflected in
        the provided abstraction of the models. However, the context impacts the semantics and
        therefore the ANF logical model allows clinical statements to be associated/related to other
        statements to describe complex clinical data. </para>

    <title>About this Document</title>
    <para>This document describes how information systems can improve patient safety and outcomes by
      increasing the precision of clinical information using a normal form to enhance and support
      quality data and analysis. In the subsequent chapter we will provide a deep dive into the
      building blocks and constructs for ANF, in a chapter containing the ANF Reference Model and
      illustrative examples of ANF modeling. </para>
    <para>Subsequently, we will outline how the various building blocks and attributes work together
      to create ANF Clinical Statements. We then provide the ANF Modeling Methodology, including a
      list of modeling principles and rules. Next, we discuss how clinical statements can be
      transformed and normalized into ANF Clinical Statements. Finally, we discuss the implications
      of ANF on data quality, clinical decision support, and ultimately, patient safety and
      outcomes. In the appendices, we explore current CIMI modeling efforts including illustrative
      examples for modeling CIMI clinical statements. We also compare and contrast ANF Clinical
      Statements and CIMI Clinical Statements in an appendix. </para>
    <note>
      <para>SNOMED CT is used as a representative example of a terminology system for the coded data
        elements in the ANF Reference Model. This ballot is focused on defining a Statement Model,
        not the underlying Terminology Knowledge layer described in the Knowledge Architecture.
        While the SNOMED CT examples are based on actual SNOMED CT definitions that are part of the
        SNOMED CT distribution, we recognize that there are inconsistencies within SNOMED CT that
        allow redundant representations. A first step in addressing the potential for redundant
        representation in the Terminology Layer is to define a separation of concerns between the
        Terminology and Statement layers to eliminate redundant representations between layers.
        Subsequent efforts to improve the quality of the Terminology Layer can then be done
        independent of the Statement layer.</para>
