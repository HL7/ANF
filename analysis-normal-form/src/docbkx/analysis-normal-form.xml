We also need clearly differentiate modeling principles (how we evaluate our model to decide if we met our requirements) from what we are currently calling Editorial Rules (might be a better phrase than editorial rules), which is how we populate the ANF structure content... 

Maybe: 

Modeling Principles

Editoral rules (creation of post-coordinated expressions)
     ?Expression rules? 

Statement rules (rules about how to create statements).

Not just FHIR, but also CDMs like OMOP and PCORI are blundering in this way. Note that this criterion means that the different models not necessarily have the same structure, nor must rely on the same terminology, but that when you ‘look through’ each model+terminology, you are able to see the same reality at the same level of granularity. That means that both models and terminologies must be based on the same ontology.

                    should allow the consistent representation of information that is commonly

                    should be captured consistently. Failure to do so forces implementers to develop
                    heuristics to capture and normalize attribution information that is represented

Why would ‘measurement’ be a single concern? Clearly, as indicated here, there are many subtypes. But then, even so clearly, ‘measurement’ is subtype of something else. What arguments do you have to place the ‘singularity’ at that level? This illustrates one of my qualms with the ‘separation of concern’ principle as indicated above.

Examples needed, although I would favor such an approach, one can’t argue that there is no ambiguity when a model is built such that disjointness of classes is to be asserted explicitly and when it isn’t, disjointness should not be assumed. Another issue is how this is impacted by temporality, e.g. ‘child’ and ‘adult’ are disjoint for human beings in the sense that at a time a human being is a child, it can’t be also an adult or the other way round. But cross time, every adult was at some earlier time a child. In the clinical notes of a longitudinal EHR the phrases ‘this child’ and ‘this adult’ may very well denote just one particular person.
"?>Dichotomies
                    are created when model fields are not completely disjoint (mutually exclusive),
                    such as allowing family history to be represented in the topic field in addition
                    to the subject of information field. False dichotomies lead to arbitrary
                    classification rules and result in ambiguity based on different assumptions
                    about the domain. False dichotomies must be eliminated by ensuring that fields
                    in the model are mutually exclusinve.</para>
