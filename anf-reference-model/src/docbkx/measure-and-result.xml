    <title>Measure and Result</title>
    <para>A unique aspect of the ANF Model is that all measures and results are numeric ranges. The
        hierarchy of classes to represent these is shown in the below, “Result Hierarchy”.
        <?oxy_comment_start author="kmaulden" timestamp="20190418T112441-0400" comment="KC: Need to explain this more. User would say, if can’t have coded results, so what good is it. In fact we can have coded results, but we put them in the topic and otherwise indicate “present”. Use some examples, where the result is “present”. Possibly the eye color example. If in ANF we allow more then one representation of e.g. eye color, we will have data retrieval problems. Users can still enter the eye color in the usual way, e.g. picking blue from a dropdown, but the data has to be transformed. Other examples could be cardiac rhythms.  " flag="done"?>An
        important point to notice in this class diagram is that the ANF Model does not allow coded
        results, only a numeric interval is possible. <?oxy_comment_end?></para>

    <para>This approach reduces data retrieval difficulties by eliminating the potential for
        multiple differing representations of the same clinical statement. For example, with coded
        results there are multiple potential methods to represent eye color that complicate data
        retrieval. The Topic couple be a Finding refined by an Observable (Iris finding->Interprets
        = Color of iris) or a Finding with no refinement (Finding of color of iris). In both of
        these cases the Result would be a qualifier of Blue color. The ANF would represent Eye color
        using the Blue iris Finding as the Topic and the Result would be Present, represented as
        Lower bound =1, Upper bound=inf. <figure>

Don’t use names for statements or building blocks thereof that are synonymous with what such statements or building blocks describe. That is typical OOD and HL7-style nonsense. What is depicted in Figure 1 is surely not a measure but a building block to document a measure.

Also HL7-ese. A measurable element of a clinical statement would be its length, the language it is written in, etc. That is for sure not what is meant here. Rename perhaps as ‘Measure BB’?

This BB lets me believe that ‘measurable’ is perhaps not the best description. Quantity? Some quantities are not measurable. Does counting counts as measuring, as in ‘5 to 10 tablets’?
"?>measurable
                element<?oxy_comment_end?>. This can be the lower bound of a range: For the “Tumor
                greater than 1 cm but less than 4 cm” the lower bound is 1. For a test result, which
                is not a range, lower and upper bound are the same. Example: systolic blood pressure
                110 mmHg. The lower and upper bound are both 110 mmHg.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>upperBound</title>
        <para>upperBound represents the upper bound of a measurable element. This can be the upper
                boundary of a range: For the “Tumor greater than 1 cm but less than 4 cm” the upper
                bound is 4. In cases, where the measurable element does not represent a range, upper
                and lower bound have the same value.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>includeLowerBound</title>
        <para>includeLowerBound states whether the lower bound in the interval is included in the
                interval. In the tumor size example above, the lower bound would not be included.
                The lower range size of 1cm is not included.</para>
        <para>The inclusion or exclusion of lower bound is needed to express measurable elements
            which include relative properties, such as “greater than”, “less than” and others.
            Example: “Persistent cough for more than 10 days”. If a lower bound of “10” is chosen,
            it would not be included, because the example states: <emphasis role="underline"
                >more</emphasis> than 10 days. Choosing “11” would require to include the lower
            bound.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>includeUpperBound</title>
        <para>includeUpperBound states whether the upper bound in the interval is included in the
            interval. Similar to lower bound, where the measurable element has relative properties,
            the same rules apply. If the upper bound of a measure is not defined, e.g. “blood
            glucose measurement daily for at least 2 weeks”, the upper bound will be captured as
            “inf” (infinite). Infinite as an upper bound is never included.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Resolution</title>
        <para>The Resolution within a measure defines the possible or allowed increments in which
            the measured “thing” can be counted. In the example of the systolic blood pressure of
            120 mmHg, the resolution is “1”, because the blood pressure measurement result can be
            counted in 1 mmHg increments. The Resolution is not always defined or known. Example: a
            clinical statement like “History of breast cancer” implies an undefined amount of time
            in the past and it is not stated, if it is years, months, etc.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>measureSemantic</title>
        <para>Measure semantic represents the unit of measure. It is described using a logical
            expression. In systolic blood pressure, the unit of measure is millimeters of mercury,
            and thus the measure semantic is a SNOMED CT concept: 259018001 |Millimeter of mercury
            (qualifier value). For blood glucose measurement daily for 2 weeks, the measure semantic
            would be “258705008 |week (qualifier value)”. In cases where the measure pertains to
            something relative to the statement time, as in the example above of “History of breast
            cancer” the standardized time/date format ISO 8601 is used for the measure semantic: ISO
            8601 prior to statement time.</para>
