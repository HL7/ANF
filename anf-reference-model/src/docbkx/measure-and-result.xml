In fact we can have coded results, but we put them in the topic and otherwise indicate “present”. Use some examples, where the result is “present”. Possibly the eye color example. If in ANF we allow more then one representation of e.g. eye color, we will have data retrieval problems. Users can still enter the eye color in the usual way, e.g. picking blue from a dropdown, but the data has to be transformed. Other examples could be cardiac rhythms.

    <para>This approach reduces data retrieval difficulties by eliminating the potential for
        multiple differing representations of the same clinical statement. For example, with coded
        results there are multiple potential methods to represent eye color that complicate data
        retrieval. The Topic could be a Finding refined by an Observable (Iris finding->Interprets
        = Color of iris) or a Finding with no refinement (Finding of color of iris). In both of
        these cases the Result would be a qualifier of Blue color. The ANF Statement would represent Eye color
        using the Blue iris Finding as the Topic and the Result would be Present, represented as
        Lower bound =1, Upper bound=inf. <figure>

        <title>Interval</title>
        <para>An interval value data type (or “interval value”) formally represents a numeric
            interval between two nonnegative real numbers. The interval can be open or closed.
            Examples of interval values are:</para>
        <para><?oxy_comment_start author="Ioana" timestamp="20190628T121330-0400" comment="Interval has both a structure and a grammar. Should we pick one?"?><emphasis>[5,5],
                [0,10), (0,inf], [0,0]</emphasis></para>
        <para>The formal syntax of interval values is represented by the following grammar:</para>
        <para><emphasis>Interval :: [ ‘[‘ | ‘(‘ ] N1 ‘,’ N2 [ ‘]’ | ‘)’ ]</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>N1 :: Non-Negative Real Number</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>N2 :: [ Non-Negative Real Number | inf ]</emphasis></para>
        <para>The semantics of this grammar are as follows:</para>
        <para><emphasis>‘[‘ and ‘]’ : Inclusive boundary (i.e. >= and &lt;= )</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>‘(‘ and ‘)’ : Exclusive boundary (i.e., > and &lt; )</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>inf: infinity, is > every Non-Negative Real Number</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>N1 &lt;= N2</emphasis><?oxy_comment_end?></para>
        <para>The interval value data type provides a single way to represent both “presence” values
            and numeric values for a phenomenon. In general, the interval value represents the
            numeric range within which the observed value of a phenomenon occurs. Note that this
            formalism allows both exact values and ranges of values to be expressed.</para>
        <para>In the special case that the beginning and end point of an interval are the same
            number, n, the meaning is that the value of the phenomenon is exactly n.</para>
        <para><emphasis>[5,5] : exactly 5 ; [0,0] : exactly 0</emphasis></para>
        <para>In the special case that the beginning of the interval is a number, n, and the end
            point is ∞, the meaning is that the value of the phenomenon is > n or >=n, depending on
            whether the interval is open or closed.</para>
        <para><emphasis>(0,inf] : > 0 ; [10,inf] : >= 10</emphasis></para>
        <para>The interval value also represents whether a phenomenon is “present”, “absent”, or
            “indeterminate”. Specifically, any interval value that includes only numbers that are >
            0 also denotes the value “present”. Any interval value that includes only the number 0,
            itself, denotes the value “absent”. Any interval value that includes both the number 0
            and at least one number > 0 denotes the value “indeterminate”. Lastly, there are two
            interval values that explicitly denote “present” and “absent,” respectively. These value
            may be assigned to phenomena that would not otherwise take on a numeric value (such as
            “nausea”):</para>

            <para>lowerBound represents the lower bound of a measurable element. This can be the
                lower bound of a range: For the “Tumor greater than 1 cm but less than 4 cm” the
                lower bound is 1. For a test result, which is not a range, lower and upper bound are
                the same. Example: systolic blood pressure 110 mmHg. The lower and upper bound are
                both 110 mmHg.</para>

        <section>
            <title>upperBound</title>
            <para>upperBound represents the upper bound of a measurable element. This can be the
                upper boundary of a range: For the “Tumor greater than 1 cm but less than 4 cm” the
                upper bound is 4. In cases, where the measurable element does not represent a range,
                upper and lower bound have the same value.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>includeLowerBound</title>
            <para>includeLowerBound states whether the lower bound in the interval is included in
                the interval. In the tumor size example above, the lower bound would not be
                included. The lower range size of 1cm is not included.</para>
            <para>The inclusion or exclusion of lower bound is needed to express measurable elements
                which include relative properties, such as “greater than”, “less than” and others.
                Example: “Persistent cough for more than 10 days”. If a lower bound of “10” is
                chosen, it would not be included, because the example states: <emphasis
                    role="underline">more</emphasis> than 10 days. Choosing “11” would require to
                include the lower bound.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>includeUpperBound</title>
            <para>includeUpperBound states whether the upper bound in the interval is included in
                the interval. Similar to lower bound, where the measurable element has relative
                properties, the same rules apply. If the upper bound of a measure is not defined,
                e.g. “blood glucose measurement daily for at least 2 weeks”, the upper bound will be
                captured as “inf” (infinite). Infinite as an upper bound is never included.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Resolution</title>
            <para>The Resolution within a measure defines the possible or allowed increments in
                which the measured “thing” can be counted. In the example of the systolic blood
                pressure of 120 mmHg, the resolution is “1”, because the blood pressure measurement
                result can be counted in 1 mmHg increments. The Resolution is not always defined or
                known. Example: a clinical statement like “History of breast cancer” implies an
                undefined amount of time in the past and it is not stated, if it is years, months,
                etc.</para>

                unit of measure<?oxy_comment_end?>. It is described using a logical expression. In
                systolic blood pressure, the unit of measure is millimeters of mercury, and thus the
                measure semantic is a SNOMED CT concept: 259018001 |Millimeter of mercury (qualifier
                value). For blood glucose measurement daily for 2 weeks, the measure semantic would
                be “258705008 |week (qualifier value)”. In cases where the measure pertains to
                something relative to the statement time, as in the example above of “History of
                breast cancer” the standardized time/date format ISO 8601 is used for the measure
                semantic: ISO 8601 prior to statement time.</para>
