        <para>This chapter describes the CIMI clinical statement model. This model uses a
        traditional structured data tree approach which can then be compared and contrasted with the
        ANF model. <note>

        <para>The central focus of the CIMI Reference Model is the CIMI Clinical Statement. A CIMI
        Clinical Statement represents structured electronic communication made about a patient
        typically documented as an 'entry' in the patient record. For example, a CIMI Clinical
        Statement can be used to represent the following statements made about a patient. </para>

        <para>CIMI Clinical Statement, shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_cstatement_0135"
            xrefstyle="select: label"/>, has a ‘topic’, ‘context’, and ‘various metadata’. The
        ‘topic’ is the clinical entity being described. The ‘context’ describes the circumstances
        that form the setting in which the ‘topic’ should be evaluated. Finally, ‘various metadata’
        is shown in the diagram for purely illustrative purposes to represent the collection of
        attributes that represent the who, where, why and when information. But 'various metadata'
        itself is not actually an attribute of CIMI Clinical Statement. </para>

        <para>CIMI adopts a compositional approach rather than inheritance, where a particular topic
            and context are added to a CIMI Clinical Statement. But topics and contexts themselves
            are defined with inheritance. This is the same general approach taken by ANF except for
            the following differences.
            CIMI defines the topic as a structured tree where ANF defines topic as a post-coordinated
            SNOMED CT expression. Both CIMI and ANF define context as a structured tree, but ANF has
            alternatively named 'context' to be 'circumstance'.
            This difference is illustrated for Pulse rate in <xref linkend="anf_cimi_diff-anfPulse"
            xrefstyle="select: label"/> and <xref linkend="anf_cimi_diff-cimiPulse"
            xrefstyle="select: label"/>.

                <para>The ‘topic’ is the clinical entity described by the Clinical Statement. A few
                    examples of topic include clinical assertions, evaluation results, and
                    procedures. For each of these topics the information described is quite
                    different. Therefore, CIMI describes topic types that contain the appropriate
                    attributes to describe the required information for the given topic. The number
                    of topic types will change as CIMI progresses. Currently the allowable topic
                    types are ProcedureTopic and FindingTopic which has subtypes of
                    EvaluationResultTopic and AssertionTopic. </para>

                <para>The topic in ANF Statement and CIMI Clinical Statement should contain the same
                    information. The ANF Statement will represent this information as a Logical
                    Expression, and CIMI represents this same information as a structured tree. </para>
                <?oxy_comment_start author="kec" timestamp="20190721T184728-0700" comment="ANF has one topic in all cases. And the topic is the same for requests and performance. How are these topics different? Is it combining some of the circumstance with the topic? "?><?oxy_comment_end?>
                <para>In both ANF Statement and CIMI Clinical Statement, the topic is represented
                    consistently across both performances and requests. The difference between a
                    performance and request is expressed in 'circumstance' for ANF Statement, and in
                    'context' for CIMI Clinical Statement. </para>

                <para>In ANF, these various structured trees representing the topic will all be
                    represented with a SNOMED CT concept or post-coordinated expression. Some CIMI
                    uses of topic will be illegal in ANF. For example, if CIMI modeled using
                    EvaluationResultTopic with a coded result in the Context, this would not be
                    possible in ANF because ANF does not allow coded results. Instead, this would
                    need to be modeled in an AssertionTopic style with the result moved into the
                    topic to be representable by ANF. Again, this difference is illustrated for
                    Pulse rate in <xref linkend="anf_cimi_diff-anfPulse" xrefstyle="select: label"/>
                    and <xref linkend="anf_cimi_diff-cimiPulse" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.</para>

                        types will change as CIMI progresses. Currently the allowable context types
                        are ActionContext and FindingContext. ActionContext has subtypes with
                        examples including RequestContext, OrderContext and PerformanceContext.
                        FindingContext has subtypes with examples such as PresenceContext,

                    is that ANF describes all quantitative results as a range. This allows ANF to

        <title>Examples Using Topic and Context</title>
        <para>Earlier, various descriptive examples of textual examples of clinical statements were given. Here we will represent similar examples using the CIMI Clinical Statement ‘topic
            - context’ paradigm. In <xref linkend="cimi_msg_cstatement_chf_0135" xrefstyle="select: label"/>, the topic has been declared to be a subtype or AssertionTopic called ConditionTopic
            stating “assertion of congestive heart failure”, and the context has been declared to be
            of type PresenceAbsenceContext stating “Known Present”. What may not be apparent in the
            figure is that when the topic is declared to be of type AssertionTopic then all the
            attributes of AssertionTopic are available for use. However, in the figure only the
            attribute named 'topicCode' is shown for clarity. </para>

        <title>CIMI Topic Patterns</title>

    <para>Topic Patterns include all the attributes required to fully describe a clinical entity.
            The topic patterns CIMI has developed to date include FindingTopic and ProcedureTopic,
            with FindingTopic having children of AssertionTopic and EvaluationResultTopic. They are
            shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_topic_hierarchy_0135" xrefstyle="select: label"/> and
            are described in the following sections. Each of these topic subtypes contain a
            collection of attributes that describe the given pattern. These patterns provide the
            foundational structure for detailed clinical model (DCM) archetype instances that can be
            visualized at <ulink url="http://models.opencimi.org"
                    ><citetitle>http://models.opencimi.org</citetitle></ulink>
        </para>

    <para>ANF, on the other hand, does not create its own topic patterns, and instead relies on SNOMED CT post-coordinated
            expressions to represent the topic. ANF operates under the principle of separation of
            concerns, and believes that terminology should be a separate concern from the ANF
            Statement data structure and its properties. </para>

        <para>The first CIMI topic type described here is the AssertionTopic pattern with its
                included attributes, as shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_assertion_0135"

                AssertionTopic has been further refined with subtypes. ConditionTopic, shown in
                    <xref linkend="cimi_msg_condition_0135" xrefstyle="select: label"/> is a child
                of AssertionTopic which is used to represent clinical findings such as the presence
                (or absence) of a condition in a patient. For example: </para>

            <title>Assertion Hierarchy</title>

            <para>The full hierarchy for AssertionTopic is shown in <xref
                        linkend="cimi_msg_assertion_hierarchy_0135" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.
                    AssertionTopic serves the following purposes: (1) it provides the core set of
                    assertion attributes that are relevant in assertion of presence and absence; and
                    (2) it is the parent type for the more specific assertions such as
                    ConditionTopic and FindingSiteAssertionTopic. If additional attributes are
                    identified as required to properly model assertions, they would either be added
                    to one of the existing assertion types or a new type could be created with these
                    attributes. This modeling decision would be based on whether adding these
                    attributes make sense for existing assertions or only for a new subset of
                    assertions. Typically an attribute is added to the parent class if that
                    attribute is relevant in all the subclasses derived from the parent class. If an
                    attribute is only relevant in some of the subclasses, then the attribute is
                    introduced in these subclasses. This ensures that a class does not have an
                    attribute that is incongruent and thus requires that attribute to be frequently
                    constrained out. As an analogy, CIMI wants to minimize the design practice that
                    would create an Animal class that contains arms, legs, and wings and then create
                    an instance of a dog that constrains out wings since dogs do not have wings. </para>

                    clinical statement. Context will be discussed in depth later in this document.
                    For now, be aware the chosen context is a full class with many attributes but

        <title>Evaluation Result</title>

        <para>The second topic pattern we will discuss is EvaluationResultTopic which is used to
                document a characteristic of a patient or a clinical value being observed. An
                EvaluationResultTopic may hold the name of a test in the ‘topicCode’ attribute
                (e.g., “heart rate evaluation”, “serum glucose laboratory test”, etc.) and the
                resulting value of the test would be represented in the context ‘result’ attribute.
                Viewed another way, the EvaluationResultTopic topicCode holds a question (e.g.,
                "what is the heart rate?", "what is the serum glucose?") and the context ‘result’
                holds the answer. Any clinical statement such as a laboratory test, a vital sign, or
                a questionnaire question that fits this pattern of a question and a resulting value
                is modeled with the EvaluationResultTopic pattern. </para>

            <title>Modeling in the Constraint Layer</title>

            <para>This section will use LaboratoryTestResultTopic, which exists in the Reference
                    Model Layer, to further describe modeling in the Constraint Layer. There are
                    different categories of laboratory tests that differ in their resulting data
                    type, such as quantitative laboratory tests and nominal laboratory tests, where
                    the former would have a Quantitative result and the latter would have a Coded
                    result. For the different laboratory categories there is not a need for new
                    named attributes to be added in the reference model layer, but only a need to
                    constrain the result to the appropriate datatype. Since a new named attribute is
                    not required, the style CIMI has adopted is to create subtypes in the constraint
                    layer, where in this case, an ADL Archetype would be created for both
                    QuantitativeLaboratoryTestResult and NominalLaboratoryTestResult. </para>

            <title>Guideline: Assertion versus Evaluation</title>

            <para>Any evaluation model may be transformed into an assertion model. Conversely, any assertion model may be transformed into an evaluation model. Some more easily than others.
            </para>

            <para>The general guideline is if it is natural to think of the concept as a noun, as a condition or state that exists in the patient, model as an assertion or set of assertions. If the statement about the patient is thought of as a name/value pair (i.e., a noun representing the attribute and an adjective representing the value), such as “hair color” = (“black”, “brown”, “blonde”), then model it as an evaluation. However, it is important to note both styles are allowed and the true determinant of their use is whether a result for a given criteria other than true/false or present/absent is specified.
            </para>

            <para>This discussion highlights the importance of isosemantic models. Even if one model or set of models can be agreed upon as the preferred style (e.g., assertion models for “bradycardia” and “tachycardia” instead of an evaluation model with “bradycardic” and “tachycardic” as values), inevitably there will be use cases (e.g., data entry, messaging, reporting, etc.) for the other model and a need to identify use cases where different modeling patterns describe semantically identical phenomena. These patterns are isosemantic. An essential (as of now unfulfilled) requirement is for a mechanism of identifying isosemantic models, managing isosemantic groups, and transforming between them. We expect a great deal of this work to be facilitated by the semantic underpinnings of the models supporting the ability to classify the content of two models and determine their logical relations (equivalent, subsumed, disjoint).
            </para>

            <para>It should be noted the Assertion vs. EvaluationResult topic is solely concerned with the structure and schema pattern used to capture clinical information. Choosing Assertion vs. EvaluationResult patterns has nothing to do with whether the information being captured is subjective vs. objective.

        <title>ProcedureTopic</title>

        <para>Procedure models are used to represent actions taken related to the care of a patient
                such as a cholecystectomy, peripheral IV placement, delivery of a warm blanket,
                dressing change, ambulation, patient education, etc. The CIMI ProcedureTopic, as
                shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_procedure_hierarchy_0135" xrefstyle="select: label"
                />, is a base class for a number of specializations such as surgical, imaging, and
                laboratory procedures. The CIMI Procedure Model is aligned with the SNOMED CT
                Procedure Concept Model when such an alignment exists. </para>

        <title>Context Patterns</title>

          <para>When a Clinical Statement is defined it will be modeled as a combination of a topic
                and a context. The ‘context’ describes the circumstances that form the setting in
                which the ‘topic’ should be evaluated. Specializations within the context hierarchy,
                shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_context_hierarchy_0135" xrefstyle="select: label"
                />, add important attribution information for the situation being described. This is
                a partial view of the context hierarchy for illustration purpose, but it should be
                clear that more context classes exist, and more will be modeled in the future as
                necessary. </para>

            <para>The first topic type described here is the Assertion pattern and its included
                attributes, as shown in Figure 6, “Assertion Pattern”, which is used to represent a
                clinical finding. This pattern is used to assert the presence (or absence) of a
                condition in a patient, for example:</para>

        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Evaluation Result</title>
            <para>
                EvaluationResult is used to document a characteristic of a patient or a
                clinical value being observed. An EvaluationResult may hold the name of a test in
                the ’topic’ (e.g., “heart rate evaluation”, “serum glucose lab test”, etc.)
                and the resulting value of the test in the ‘result’ attribute. Viewed another way,
                the EvaluationResult ‘topic’ holds a question (e.g., "what is the heart rate?", "what
                is the serum glucose?") and the ‘result’ holds the answer. Any clinical statement
                such as a laboratory test, a vital sign, or a questionnaire question that fits this
                pattern of a question and a resulting value can be modeled with the EvaluationResult
                pattern. 
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Assertion vs. Evaluation Result</title>
            <para>
                In most cases, the decision between using the evaluation result pattern and the
                assertion pattern is intuitive and straightforward. “Urine color”, for example, is
                clearly best modeled as an evaluation result because the property being evaluated is
                the color of the patient’s urine and the result of the evaluation is the set of
                codes representing the colors that may be observed. To model urine color as an
                assertion would require the creation of a large number of pre-coordinated concepts –
                the key would be “assertion” and result would be populated with a code from a set of
                codes such as “amber urine” (meaning “the patient has amber urine”), “clear urine”,
                etc. However, this highlights any evaluation model may be transformed into an
                assertion model. (Conversely, any assertion model may be transformed into an
                evaluation model.) In the case of urine color, the decision is intuitive. But in
                other cases, the decision is less clear.</para>

        <title>CIF Issues with data retrieval</title>
        <para>Ideally, the way the information is presented to clinicians is in a manner that is
            most efficient for the clinicians to use. However, what is an efficient way for
            clinicians to select and enter data may not be the most efficient way for data analysts
            to use when they are querying data once it has been normalized and stored in a database,
            such as when creating a new CDS rule or compiling prevalence statistics. For this, the
            data is normalized using the <emphasis role="italic">Analysis Normal Form (ANF)
            </emphasis>and stored in a database. Again, the ANF is not necessarily a physical
            structure, but is how a data analyst might see the data when they are looking at it in a
            database, and not as clinicians would see it in the user interface (i.e., CIF).</para>
        <para>The more that data is normalized, the simpler it will become to analyze, and the
            likelihood of analysis errors will be reduced. The critical part of this is to ensure
            that information is not lost between the CIF and the ANF data normalization.Without the
            ANF, the probability of patient safety risks is increased. </para>
