    <para>Clinical Statement is the main class which describes an entry of clinical information into
        the patient record. Most importantly it contains the 'topic' which describes what this
        statement is about, and the 'circumstance' which will contain either request or result
        information regarding the 'topic'.</para>

        <para>Subject of Information is a coded field used to express <emphasis role="bold">WHO

            statements not only about the patient, but also statements about children, relatives and
            donors. Thus, some possible values for subjectOfInformation, would include codes for
            'subject of record' (the patient), 'family member', or 'donor'. The majority of
            statements will have a subjectOfInformation with a value of 'subject of record', since

        <title>statementType</title>
        <para>Statement Type distinguishes between a performance ('performed') and a request
            ('requested'). Performances may be observational performances, e.g. the observation of a
            clinical finding or disorder being present or absent. They can also be a procedure or
            intervention which has been performed on the subject of record in the past, e.g. “a
            procedure using a 12-lead electrocardiogram”. Performances can – but do not have to –
            include quantitative or qualitative results, e.g. “3 dot blot hemorrhages” or “Hepatitis
            A antibody positive”.</para>

This comment is written after I made other comments on assertions in section 1.6.10. Although I get, I think, the gist, this entire section – and actually the entire larger section 1.6 – is unclear because of insufficient distinction between what is description and what the description is about. Section 1.6’s title is ‘clinical statement components’ and the impression is given that the components are listed one by one in the subsections. The main problem I have is that there is not explicit enough distinction between what is on the side of the patient – e.g. a tumor – and what is on the side of documentation thereof, i.e. what a clinical statement should be, f.i. ‘observation of tumor’, ‘removal of tumor’, … Now are ‘clinical statement components’ strictly components of descriptions or does it include components of the patient itself? If it is only on the side of the description, is it to be taken as a literal part of the description, does it include implicit components that are identified in certain linguistic theories about term formation (e.g. case grammar, case theory, …). Most essential to get clear is what ‘topic’ exactly stands for.

You don’t mean that just the phrase ‘stress echocardiogram’ is a request for action? It could as well be an observation that it was done.

But surely you should disambiguate between the phenomena themselves and the observations thereof. Plus be more precise about what ‘observation’ exactly is, otherwise you get trapped in HL7-nonsense. Clearly, you can only observe phenomena that are there: you can only observe congestive heart failure in a patient when it is there. But you can state in a record that the patient has CHF without he having it. In such case, the clinician might believe he observed an instance of CHF, but he did not observe it. Furthermore, ‘observe’ should not be overloaded with ‘deduce’. You can’t observe ‘psychosis’, only deduce it on the basis of …

This is unclear. Is the topic part of the assertion, or is it that what (part of) the assertion is about? If it is what the assertion is about, it cannot have clarity of meaning. If the topic is the patient’s CHF, what would be the clarity of meaning of his disease? Is it the assertion, then do you mean that instances of the specified type must exist (perhaps not in this patient), or that it must be able to exist in the patient (thus accounting for mistakes, misdiagnosis, …)?

But that the mother of the patient had colon cancer is both about the mother, the cancer and the patient. So ‘aboutness’ of observations/measurement must be much better characterized.

Lack of distinction between the observation as an action and that what is observed leads to ambiguity about whether an absent observed finding is an assertion about whether, for example, a requested observation was not done, or whether it was done but there was nothing to observe.

Ironically, this is one of the few things that IS clear to me. It should describe the circumstances which are conditions for the requested action to be performed, ‘when awake’, ‘after breakfast’, ‘if x still present after 3 days’, …Main issue is not to confuse it with the WHEN although many triggers can be expressed as such and not to leave anything implicit: e.g. if a trigger is ‘after breakfast’ doesit mean that if pt did not have breakfast it shouldn’t happen?  What is not clear, however, is how to squeeze such distinctions with enough clarity in formal expressions.

Here might be situations under which the limitations of terminology models may come in play: the ANF principles should allow that specific persons can be asked for, e.g. not just any ‘attending cardiologist,, but ‘Dr. XYZ’.

Brings in another level of confusion: I thought this entire discussion was about documenting what is on the side of the patient, here you include documenting how clinical statements are configured.
