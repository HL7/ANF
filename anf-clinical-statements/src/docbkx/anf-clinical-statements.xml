This is too imprecise:
1) ‘structured’ according to what? Sentences are also structured, some according to English grammar, others according to a grammar for technical sublanguage (see Naomi Sager’s Linguistic String project).
2) ‘computable’ by whom or what? Some algorithms can, others can’t.
3) ‘A clinical statement REPRESENTS and entry in the patient record’: do you mean (a) ‘is’ an entry, such that if x is an instance of Clinical Statement, then x is also an instance of Entry in a Patient Record, or (b) if x is instance of Clinical Statement, then there is some y instance of Entry in the Patient record such that x represents y, or (c) the ‘documents’ restricts the scope of what record entries qualify as clinical statements, namely those that document clinical information?
4) ‘Clinical Information’? this extends the previous issue: is this a third thing z instance of Clinical Information such that x represents y and y documents z? I would argue that clinical statements and clinical information under whatever interpretation.

Can clinicians author clinical statements without entering them in the record? If so, then the description in the previous paragraphs about what a ‘clinical statement’ is becomes even more problematic
"?>Clinicians
        author clinical statements and enter them into their organization’s electronic health record

        call here the clinical input form (CIF). However, the CIF is not a literal form that
        clinicians select and enter data in. Rather, it refers to the manner in which information is
        presented to the clinicians and how they enter the data, such as by constraining the
        information to allow only certain values to be entered, such as through a drop-down list or
        radio button, or breaking up large chunks of related information into smaller parts.</para>

Such family history is clinically relevant but is not a characteristic of the patient. I suggest to make this a 3rd type of clinical statement. If you insist on classifying statements based on what they are about, then you would have (1) statements which describe the patient as a whole, any part of him, or any entities that depend on him or his parts (qualities, realizables, processes in which he or his parts participate); (2) statements about requests for actions that once executed will results in statements of type 1 or type 3, and (3) statements about clinically relevant phenomena that occurred or have occurred in his environment but are not about the patient himself.

I think it would be valuable if we could show how ANF can improve the precision of “clinical statements”.
Both C-CDA and FHIR US core specify profiles intended to represent data captured by EHRs. If we could show how an EHR-produced “result” could be represented in ANF.
We could propose this improvement to Orders&amp;Observations, Patient Care, and Clinical Decision Support work groups.
