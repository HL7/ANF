    <para>Implementers may use the logical model and methodology in this document to design software

        specifications required across the US (e.g. FHIR US Core, Consolidated CDA). Since
        information sharing already relies on a variety of clinical statement approaches and syntax
        representations, it will become necessary to create normalized instances of those clinical
        statements intended for reuse. Not all the data produced by a system is necessary for
        analysis; and, the ANF model - like other CIMI models - is focused on

            is a logical model intended to represent any clinical data using a complete yet simple
            normal form. It allows other software modules to reuse the information and derive new
            knowledge from it. Examples of ANF's benefits include improved ability to (1) analyze
            the care that was delivered, (2) find out what type care leads to the best patient
            outcomes, and (3) use rules and business triggers to automate clinical decision and
            workflow steps. <?oxy_comment_end?>ANF could be used to design standards-based
            Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) optimized for a specific analysis purpose. ANF
            APIs may be implemented using FHIR resources, profiles, and extensions to access
            clinical decision support, clinical quality measures, and to support workflow automation
            by triggering reminders and clinical notifications.</para>
        <para>ANF statements may be created from existing clinical statements and patient-entered
            data to support APIs intended for Analysis or to automate information derived from device

                    <para>The typical implementation of ANF will be a system that normalizes
                clinical information (e.g. FHIR, CDA documents) to be used by business and decision
                support rules. Healthcare enterprises may use middleware, standards-based
                transformation and terminology servers to normalize a variety of observations,
                orders, diagnoses, medications, procedure notes, and other interventions to a set of
                        <glossterm baseform="ANF Performance">Performance</glossterm> or <glossterm baseform="ANF Request">Request</glossterm> statements. Narrative clinical statements may not be
                immediately reducible to ANF and it may require natural language processing and
                other methods of augmentation and enhancement.</para>

                    <para>ANF-specific resources and implementation guidance can be tested during
                        FHIR Connectathons to validate that the logical model outlined in this
                        specification is suitable to data aggregation and supports the analysis
                        objectives of researchers, before proposing them as new resources for future
                        versions of FHIR and as extensions and profiles for current versions. Both
                        approaches may be desirable.</para>

                   <para>ANF statements may be created as an outcome of evaluating device,
                clinician, patient-entered data (e.g. questionnaires) automatically and in
                near-real-time. For example, specific answers to a PHQ-9 screening tool along with
                previous assessments could trigger a specific type of follow-up screening regarding
                substance use treatment or further evaluation, consideration of Social Determinants
                of Health, or alert to a provider. While ANF statements are not intended as an input
                form, such statements could be automatically generated by learning EHR systems [14]
                using on a combination of pre-existing clinical data, clinical guidelines/rules,
                medical device observation and patient-generated data. The promise of the Learning
                EHR system [18] is the ability to learn new knowledge from previous clinical
                statements and latest scientific developments. This approach also conducive to
                tailoring treatment consistent with Precision Medicine [14] and reducing provider
                burden through automation.</para>

        <para>Interoperability standards sometimes pose challenges due to the use of
            synthetics/abstract data types that attempt to capture the complexity of healthcare
            data. ANF simplifies the statement structure by using a small set of primitive types
            (e.g. float, varchar, boolean) and a sophisticated terminology . Data warehousing and
            mining solutions rely need a consistent simple representation of data organized along
            facts and axes. ANF borrows from Database Normalization the idea that "normalization" to
            reduce data redundancy and improve integrity. The ANF logical be used to design database
            "fact based" dimensional schemas that enable analysis focused on a specific set of facts
            and dimensions to evaluate outcomes associated with the use of a specific therapy,
            device, or medication. .</para>
