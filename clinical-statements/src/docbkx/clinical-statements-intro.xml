o	Should be written at a higher level for general understanding of the problem
o	Non-technical explanation of issues around clinical content and data analysis
o	Explain, how same piece of clinical data can be recorded in multiple different ways (CIF).
o	Start with simple examples of “Pulse” (Pulse by method, Pulse by patient status) and Blood Pressure (Systolic BP 120 mmHg, taken on right brachial artery), then go into some more complex examples
	Cite reference study about importance of patient position, micturition etc.

        Statements are used to model all “entries” in a Clinical Document Architecture(CDA) document
        section. The Clinical Statement “Common Model Element Type” (CMET) is the base model for the
        all Consolidated CDA “clinical statement” templates that are still mandatory for Electronic
        Health Record (EHR) vendors. The concept of “clinical statement” is widely understood though
        there is an issue with consistency across HL7 paradigms: V3, CDA, and
        FHIR.<?oxy_comment_end?></para>

        <title>Normative HL7 V3 Clinical Statement Definition</title>
        <para>“An expression of a discrete item of clinical, clinically-related or public health
            information that is recorded because of its relevance to the care of a patient or other
            entity. Clinical or public health information can be expressed with different levels of
            granularity and therefore the extent and detail conveyed in a single statement may vary.
            To be regarded as a Clinical Statement, a concept must be associated with a patient or
            other entity in a manner which makes clear:</para>
