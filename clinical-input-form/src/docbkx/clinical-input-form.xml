        <title>Introduction to CIMI Clinical Statements </title>

        <para>
            The central focus of the CIMI Reference Model is the CIMI Clinical Statement. A CIMI Clinical Statement represents structured electronic communication made about a patient typically documented as an 'entry' in the patient record. For example, a CIMI Clinical Statement can be used to represent the following statements made about a patient.

        <para>
            CIMI Clinical Statement, shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_cstatement_0135"/>, has a ‘topic’, ‘context’, and ‘metadata’.  The ‘topic’ is the clinical entity being described.  The ‘context’ describes the circumstances that form the setting in which the ‘topic’ should be evaluated.  Finally, ‘metadata’ is the collection of metadata that is associated with the clinical statement: the who, where, why and when information.
        </para>

        <para>
            CIMI adopts a compositional approach rather than inheritance, where a particular topic and context are added to a CIMI Clinical Statement.  But topics and contexts themselves are defined with inheritance. This is the same general approach taken by ANF except for the following differences.  CIMI defines the topic as a structured tree where ANF defines topic as a post-coordinated Snomed expression.  Both CIMI and ANF define context as a structured tree, but ANF has named context to be 'circumstance'

                        The ‘topic’ is the clinical entity described by the Clinical Statement. A few examples of topic include clinical assertions, evaluation results, and procedures. For each of these topics the information described is quite different. Therefore, CIMI describes topic types that contain the appropriate attributes to describe the required information for the given topic. The number of topic types will change as CIMI progresses. Currently the allowable topic types are EventTopic, ProcedureTopic and FindingTopic which has suptypes of EvaluationResultTopic and AssertionTopic.

                        The ‘context’ describes the circumstances that form the setting in which the ‘topic’ should be evaluated. CIMI describes context types that contain the appropriate attributes to describe the required information for the given context. The number of context types will change as CIMI progresses. Currently the allowable context types are EventContext, ActionContext, and FindingContext.  ActionContext has subtypes with examples including RequestContext, OrderContext and PerformanceContext. FindingContext has subtypes with examples such as PresenceContext, AbsenceContext, and GoalContext.

                        ‘metadata’ is not actually an attribute of ClinicalStatement, but is intended here to represent the various attributes in clinical statement that represent metadata about the clinical statement. This includes attribution information relating to the statement itself such as who authored, verified, recorded, or signed the statement or more informally, the who, where, why, and when information. Other attributes of this nature are recordStatus and encounter.

        <title>Examples Using Topic and Context</title>

        <para>     
          Earlier, descriptive examples of Clinical Statements were given.  Here we will represent a few of these examples using the Clinical Statement ‘topic - context’ paradigm.  In <xref linkend="cimi_msg_cstatement_chf_0135"/>, the example for “Patient has diagnosis of congestive heart failure” is illustrated. The topic has been declared to be of type AssertionTopic stating “assertion of congestive heart failure”, and the context has been declared to be of type PresenceAbsenceContext stating “Known Present”. What may not be apparent in the figure is that when the topic is declared to be of type AssertionTopic then all the attributes of AssertionTopic are available for use. However, in the figure only the attribute named ‘result’ is shown for clarity.  
        </para>

        <para>
          In <xref linkend="cimi_msg_cstatement_order_0135"/>, the example for “Patient has an order for Physical Therapy.” is shown. The topic has been declared to be of type ProcedureTopic stating “procedure of type physical therapy”, and the context has been declared to be of type OrderContext. Again, the majority of attributes for ProcedureTopic and OrderContext are not shown for clarity.
        </para>

        <title>CIMI Topic Patterns</title>

    <para>
        Topic Patterns include all the attributes required to fully describe a clinical entity. The topic patterns CIMI has developed to date include FindingTopic, ProcedureTopic, and EventTopic, with FindingTopic having children of AssertionTopic and EvaluationResultTopic. They are shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_topic_hierarchy_0135"/> and are described in the following sections. Each of these topic subtypes contain a collection of attributes that describe the given pattern.  These patterns provide the foundational structure for detailed clinical model (DCM) archetype instances that can be visualized at <ulink url="http://models.opencimi.org"><citetitle>http://models.opencimi.org</citetitle></ulink> 
    </para>

    <para>
        ANF does not create its own topic patterns, and instead relies on Snomed post-coordinated expressions to represent the topic.  ANF operates under the principle of separation of concerns, and here believes that terminology should be a separate concern from ANF Statement data structure.

            The first topic type described here is the AssertionTopic pattern with its included attributes, as shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_assertion_0135"/>. ConditionTopic, shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_condition_0135"/> is a child of AssertionTopic which is used to represent a clinical finding such as the presence (or absence) of a condition in a patient. For example:

        <section>
            <title>Assertion Hierarchy</title>

            <para>
                The full hierarchy for AssertionTopic is shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_assertion_hierarchy_0135"/>.  AssertionTopic serves two important purposes: (1) it provides the core set of assertion attributes that are relevant in assertion of presence and absence; and (2) it is the parent type for the more specific assertions such as ConditionTopic and FindingSiteAssertionTopic. If additional attributes are identified as needed to properly model assertions they would either be added to one of the existing assertion types or a new type could be created with these attributes. This modeling decision would be based on whether adding these attributes make sense for existing assertions types or whether they should be used to create a new subset of assertions. Typically an attribute is added to the parent class if that attribute is relevant in all the subclasses derived from the parent class. If an attribute is only relevant in some of the subclasses then the attribute is introduced in these subclasses. This ensures that a class does not have an attribute that is incongruent and thus requires that attribute to be occasionally constrained out. For instance, it is viewed as bad practice to create an Animal class that contains arms, legs, and wings and then create a subclass of dog that constrains out wings since dogs do not have wings.
            </para>

            <para>
                Note there are two ways to introduce an attribute that is not always used. A UML class specialization specifies a new class that has all of the attributes of its parent and may then specify additional attributes. An archetype may choose to use whichever class, parent or child, is appropriate. Or, the additional attribute may be added to the original class and the archetype may then use the attribute or "constrain it out" by setting its cardinality to zero. As previously state, CIMI modelers prefer the first approach, extension through UML class specialization, that avoids the need to constrain elements out of archetypes.

            <title>Assertions</title>

            <para>
                Assertions affirm or deny the existence of clinical conditions, diseases, symptoms, etc., in the patient.  As just described, different varieties of assertion may extend an existing AssertionTopic class with any additional attributes necessary to fully represent this new group of assertions. Table 1 shows examples of clinical statements using the AssertionTopic class for the topic, and Table 2 shows examples of clinical statement using FindingSiteAssertionTopic for the topic.  These examples show the ‘topic.topicCode’, ‘topic.result’, and ‘context.contextCode’ for each, with the addition of any extra attributes from the chosen topic needed to describe the clinical statement.  Context will be discussed in depth later in this document. For now, be aware the chosen context is a full class with many attributes but here we are only showing the context code attribute that is common to all context types.
            </para>

            <para>
                Note, in the CIMI alignment with the SNOMED CT concept model, the AssertionTopic pattern corresponds to the Finding hierarchy as inflected by the Situation hierarchy.

            </para>

            <para>
                Other attributes may also inflect the semantics; e.g., an AssertionStatment.topic.findingMethod that would align with the concept model’s Finding.findingMethod.

            <title>Finding Site Assertions</title>

            <para>
                A FindingSiteAssertionTopic is an assertion about a finding found on the body. This assertion is a “design by extension” assertion because it contains the additional attribute findingSite that is used to capture the body site affected by the condition. The FindingSiteAssertionTopic encourages post-coordination as shown in examples 3 and 4, and intentionally aligns with the SNOMED CT Clinical Findings concept model.

        <title>Evaluation Result</title>

        <para>
            The second topic pattern we will discuss is EvaluationResultTopic which is used to document a characteristic of a patient or a clinical value being observed. An EvaluationResultTopic may hold the name of a test in the ‘topicCode’ attribute (e.g., “heart rate evaluation”, “serum glucose lab test”, etc.) and the resulting value of the test in the ‘result’ attribute. Viewed another way, the EvaluationResultTopic topicCode holds a question (e.g., "what is the heart rate?", "what is the serum glucose?") and the ‘result’ holds the answer. Any clinical statement such as a laboratory test, a vital sign, or a questionnaire question that fits this pattern of a question and a resulting value is modeled with the EvaluationResultTopic pattern.
        </para>

        <para>
           The evaluation result pattern for a clinical statement is as follows:
        </para> 

        <itemizedlist mark='bullet' spacing='compact'>
            <listitem>
              <para>

        </itemizedlist>


        <para>
            The following is an isosemantic comparison of the evaluation result pattern to the previously described assertion pattern.  In the previous section, we illustrated assertion models using rash, auto accident, and hypertrophy.  Below we show what these assertion examples would look like if we hypothetically modeled them using the Evaluation Result pattern.  Note, CIMI avoids creating models where the ‘result’ specifies “presence/absence” or “yes/no”, so this is a clear indicator that the assertion pattern is preferred in these cases.

            <title>Modeling in the Constraint Layer</title>

            <para>
                This section will use LaboratoryTestResultTopic, which exists in the Reference Model Layer, to further describe modeling in the Constraint Layer. There are different categories of laboratory tests that differ in their resulting data type, such as quantitative labs and nominal labs, where the former would have a QUANTITY result and the latter would have a CODED_TEXT result. For the different lab categories there is not a need for new named attributes only a need to constrain the result to the appropriate datatype. The modeler has a choice to make in this situation as the datatype could be constrained in a new class subtype in the reference layer or as an archetype in the constraint layer.  Since a new named attribute is not required the style CIMI has adopted as the constraint would occur in the constraint layer and an ADL Archetype would be created for both QuantitativeLaboratoryTestResult and NominalLaboratoryTestResult.

            <title>Guideline: Assertion versus Evaluation</title>

            <para>
                In most cases the decision between using the evaluation result pattern and the assertion pattern is intuitive and straightforward. “Urine color”, for example, is clearly best modeled as an evaluation result because the attribute being evaluated is the color of the patient’s urine and the result of the evaluation is the set of codes representing the colors that may be observed.  To model urine color as an assertion would require the creation of a large number of pre-coordinated concepts. The key would be “assertion” and result would be populated with a code from a set of codes such as “amber urine” (meaning “the patient has amber urine”), “clear urine”, etc.
            </para>

            <para>
                However, this highlights any evaluation model may be transformed into an assertion model. (Conversely, any assertion model may be transformed into an evaluation model.) In the case of urine color, the decision is intuitive. In other cases the decision is less clear.
            </para>

            <para>
                For example, “heart rhythms” (bradycardic, tachycardic, etc.) may be modeled as multiple assertion models (bradycardia, tachycardia, etc.) or as a “heart rhythms” evaluation model whose data is constrained to a value set (containing “bradycardic”, “tachycardic”, etc.).
            </para>

            <para>
                The general guideline is if it is natural to think of the concept as a noun, as a condition or state that exists in the patient, model as an assertion or set of assertions. If the statement about the patient is thought of as a name/value pair (i.e., a noun representing the attribute and an adjective representing the value), such as “hair color” = (“black”, “brown”, “blonde”), then model it as an evaluation. However, it is important to note both styles are allowed and the true determinant of their use is whether a result for a given criteria other than true/false or present/absent is specified.
            </para>

            <para>
                This discussion highlights the importance of isosemantic models. Even if one model or set of models can be agreed upon as the preferred storage model (e.g., assertion models for “bradycardia” and “tachycardia” instead of an evaluation model with “bradycardic” and “tachycardic” as values), inevitably there will be use cases (e.g., data entry, messaging, reporting, etc.) for the other model and a need to identify use cases where different modeling patterns describe semantically identical phenomena. These patterns are isosemantic. An essential (as of now unfulfilled) requirement is for a mechanism of identifying isosemantic models, managing isosemantic groups, and transforming between them. We expect a great deal of this work to be facilitated by the semantic underpinnings of the models supporting the ability to classify the content of two models and determine their logical relations (equivalent, subsumed, disjoint).
            </para>

            <para>
                It should be noted the Assertion vs. Evaluation topic is solely concerned with the structure and schema pattern used to capture clinical information. Choosing Assertion vs. Evaluation patterns has nothing to do with whether the information being captured is subjective vs. objective.

            Procedure models are used to represent actions taken related to the care of a patient such as a cholecystectomy, peripheral IV placement, delivery of a warm blanket, dressing change, ambulation, patient education, etc.  The CIMI ProcedureTopic, as shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_procedure_hierarchy_0135"/>,  is a base class for a number of specializations such as surgical, imaging, and laboratory procedures. The CIMI Procedure Model is aligned with the SNOMED CT Procedure Concept Model when such an alignment exists.

          <para>
            When a Clinical Statement is defined it will be modeled as a combination of a topic and a context. The ‘context’ describes the circumstances that form the setting in which the ‘topic’ should be evaluated. Specializations within the context hierarchy, shown in <xref linkend="cimi_msg_context_hierarchy_0135"/>, add important attribution information for the situation being described.

        <title>CIMI Topic Patterns</title>
        <para>The topic patterns CIMI has developed to date to include Assertion, EvaluationResult, and
            Procedure. Each of these topic subtypes contains a collection of attributes that are
            appropriate to describe the given pattern. These patterns provide the foundational
            structure for detailed clinical model archetype instances (ref
            https://issues.osehra.org/secure/attachment/15835/cimi_modeling_quality_guide.pdf ) </para>

            <title>Assertion</title>
            <para>The first topic type described here is the Assertion pattern and its included
                attributes, as shown in Figure 6, “Assertion Pattern”, which is used to represent a
                clinical finding. This pattern is used to assert the presence (or absence) of a
                condition in a patient, for example:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>ChestPainAssertion asserts the presence of chest pain</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>ChestPainAssertion asserts the absence of chest pain</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>EdemaAssertion asserts the presence of edema</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Evaluation Result</title>
            <para>
                EvaluationResult is used to document a characteristic of a patient or a
                clinical value being observed. An EvaluationResult may hold the name of a test in
                the ’topic’ (e.g., “heart rate evaluation”, “serum glucose lab test”, etc.)
                and the resulting value of the test in the ‘result’ attribute. Viewed another way,
                the EvaluationResult ‘topic’ holds a question (e.g., "what is the heart rate?", "what
                is the serum glucose?") and the ‘result’ holds the answer. Any clinical statement
                such as a laboratory test, a vital sign, or a questionnaire question that fits this
                pattern of a question and a resulting value can be modeled with the EvaluationResult
                pattern. 
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Assertion vs. Evaluation Result</title>
            <para>
                In most cases, the decision between using the evaluation result pattern and the
                assertion pattern is intuitive and straightforward. “Urine color”, for example, is
                clearly best modeled as an evaluation result because the property being evaluated is
                the color of the patient’s urine and the result of the evaluation is the set of
                codes representing the colors that may be observed. To model urine color as an
                assertion would require the creation of a large number of pre-coordinated concepts –
                the key would be “assertion” and result would be populated with a code from a set of
                codes such as “amber urine” (meaning “the patient has amber urine”), “clear urine”,
                etc. However, this highlights any evaluation model may be transformed into an
                assertion model. (Conversely, any assertion model may be transformed into an
                evaluation model.) In the case of urine color, the decision is intuitive. But in
                other cases, the decision is less clear.</para>

        <title>CIF Issues with data retrieval</title>
        <para>Ideally, the way the information is presented to clinicians is in a manner that is
            most efficient for the clinicians to use. However, what is an efficient way for
            clinicians to select and enter data may not be the most efficient way for data analysts
            to use when they are querying data once it has been normalized and stored in a database,
            such as when creating a new CDS rule or compiling prevalence statistics. For this, the
            data is normalized using the <emphasis role="italic">Analysis Normal Form (ANF)
            </emphasis>and stored in a database. Again, the ANF is not necessarily a physical
            structure, but is how a data analyst might see the data when they are looking at it in a
            database, and not as clinicians would see it in the user interface (i.e., CIF).</para>
        <para>The more that data is normalized, the simpler it will become to analyze, and the
            likelihood of analysis errors will be reduced. The critical part of this is to ensure
            that information is not lost between the CIF and the ANF data normalization.Without the
            ANF, the probability of patient safety risks is increased. </para>
