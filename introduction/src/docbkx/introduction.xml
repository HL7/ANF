  <title>Introduction<?oxy_comment_start author="kmaulden" timestamp="20190423T093902-0400" comment="Note from Keith: For the ANF document, we should somewhere describe assumptions about what an ANF implementation requires. For example, ANF requires an ability to classify topic expressions (and expressions that may go in other locations). Maybe a section that describes the requirements of a &quot;mapping&quot; based system with a plethora of statement models, and then what ANF requires above and beyond a mapping system, and what the benefits are. 
Re-using some of the work in the interoperability paper is probably wise. I think a distillation of key concepts should be part of the HL7 ballot document. We need to motivate why an ANF approch is necessary as opposed to the status quo.

    <section>
      <title>Context</title>
      <para>Health care organizations are striving to become high reliability organizations (HROs),
        characterized by high levels of safety under inherently risky, technologically-complex, and
        demanding conditions.( <link
          xlink:href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/medstar_hit_safety_1_29_v2.pdf"
          >https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/medstar_hit_safety_1_29_v2.pdf</link>)
        Chassin and Loeb published a conceptual framework for assessing progress towards becoming a
        HRO and included the safe use of health IT and review of quality measures, which are
        dependent on data from Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. (<link
          xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3790522/"
          >https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3790522/</link>) Deployment of EHR systems
        is nearly ubiquitous in the US and there is increasing opportunity to leverage a substantial
        number of extant EHR mapped data sets to improve population health through quality measures,
        case reporting, and decision support. </para>
      <para>Pragmatically, these electronic tools are implemented by manually mapping the right
        clinical data stated in specifications from the right sources in the EHR to generate a
        report. While there are published, standardized specifications of measures, reports, and
        alerts with machine-readable, human-readable, and value set specifications, there is
        currently vast variation seen in implementations of these tools across the healthcare system
        (refs xxx). Some of this variation is due to discrepancies in how implementers of these
        reports interpret the expression-logic of specifications. However, even if the
        implementations of query logic were standardized there is still existing variation in the
        representation of how clinical data within an EHR is organized, the clinical terminology
        that is applied, the value range that is valid, which units of measurement may be used, and
        which data values are required (<link

      <title>Representation of Clinical Statements</title>
      <para>To assist with these challenges, The Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) is
        an HL7 group that is defining a library of de- tailed clinical information models using a
        common modeling formalism. CIMI was established to improve the interoperability of
        healthcare information systems through shared implementable clinical information models that
        can be used to generate platform-specific model specifications such as FHIR profiles or CDA
        templates. These models are grouped into semantically equivalent (or ‘isosemantic’) families
        of clinical models, which capture the same clinical meaning using different combinations of
        concept pre-coordination and corresponding information model structure. The central focus of
        the CIMI Reference Model is the Clinical Statement. A Clinical Statement represents
        structured electronic communication made about a patient typically documented as an 'entry'
        in the patient record. For example, Clinical Statement can be used to represent the
        following statements made about a patient. This can be the statement of a condition being
        present, a request for a procedure to be done, the results of lab tests or the patient’s
        family history of cancer.<itemizedlist>

      <para>Let's consider the following example for blood pressure measurement and the clinical
        statement that may be entered to represent this information.</para>
      <para>“Systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, taken on right brachial artery, using adult size
        blood pressure cuff, patient in sitting position for at least 5 minutes, urinated no more
        than 30 minutes prior to measurement”. For the user, this would be the easiest way to
        document the measurement. However, the various parts of information about the body site, the
        blood pressure cuff, patient position etc. would be lost to any attempt of data retrieval.
        Rather than selecting this information all at once with a single item, the user could choose
        the various parts of information pertinent to the blood pressure measurement in various
        ways. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Structured Data Capture</title>
      <para>Clinicians author clinical statements and enter them into their organization’s EHR
        systems. Clinical statements can be expressed and documented in many different ways in EHR
        systems, where input forms provide different options to document the same clinical
        statement. These differences pose challenges for data retrieval, data analysis and data
        analysts in their attempts to extract accurate clinical analysis results. </para>
      <para>Clinicians enter clinical statements into their organization’s EHR typically in a manner
        that we call here structured data capture, or the manner in which information is presented
        to the clinicians and how they enter the data, such as by constraining the information to
        allow only certain values to be entered, e.g. through a drop-down list or radio button, or
        breaking up large chunks of related information into smaller parts.</para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="underline">The following example illustrates
            challenges with Structured Data Capture:</emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis>Systolic Blood Pressure 120 mmHg, taken on right brachial artery, using BP
          cuff adult size, patient in sitting position for at least 5 minutes, urinated not more
          than 30 minutes prior to measurement</emphasis></para>
      <para>The current guidance for blood pressure measurements for adults includes the body site,
        the blood pressure cuff size to use as well as some prerequisites. The patient should be in
        a sitting position for at least 5 minutes and should have urinated no more than 30 minutes
        before the measurement.</para>
      <para>For example, a EHR could display a text field for the result and lists of choices for
        the body site:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Right brachial artery</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Left brachial artery</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Or it could be diplayed with the site and allow further refinement to specify the
        laterality:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Brachial artery</para>
          <itemizedlist>

            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>In addition to specifiying the body site a list of choices for the blood pressure cuff
        size used would also be selected, for example:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Adult size Small</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Adult size Large</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The same could be true for the display and documentation option for the patient position
        (sitting yes/no, how long, urinated yes/no, how long prior to measurement), which could
        differ between systems. There are different ways the measurement result could be entered
        into a form in an EHR. Display options for the user could be, e.g. a text field to enter the
        measurement result (e.g. 120 mmHg) with the label of the complete guideline. </para>
      <para>Ideally,clinical information is modeled in a manner that is most efficient for use. This
        is a problem because there are many different use cases for clinical information with a wide
        range of requirements. There is no single model that can be the most efficient model for all
        the various use cases. Maximum efficiency for each use case necessitates that any particular
        clinical information be available in multiple modeled forms. These models, although
        different in form, semantically represent the same information, and are known as isosemantic
        models. Any particular detailed clinical model exists within a family of isosemantic
        siblings. </para>
      <para>Different isosemantic models can support different purposes, such as clinical data
        input, clinical data storage, clinical data querying, clinical data analysis, and modeler
        preference. </para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section><title> Purpose </title>
    <para>Here, we introduce a new isosemantic representation that is designed to aid in the
      analysis of clinical information and will represent one member in each isosemantic family of
      detailed clinical models. This representation is called Analysis Normal Form (ANF). A FHIR
      implementation guide can eventually be developed. </para>
    <para>ANF is not necessarily a physical structure, but is how a data analyst might see the data
      when they are looking at it in a database, and not as clinicians would see it in the user
      interface (i.e., structured data capture). </para>

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The goal of ANF is to enable analysts to understand the data and how it is stored in lieu
      of having to teach them about the thousands of ways data can be entered and ensure the data
      that has to be expressed, can be expressed in an operable and scalable way. The more that data
      is normalized, the simpler it will become to analyze, and the likelihood of analysis errors
      will be reduced. Without the ANF, the probability of patient safety risks is increased.</para>
    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">purpose of ANF</emphasis> is suggested as follows:</para>
    <para>The purpose of ANF is to provide precise semantic consistent data and terminology
      specification that are comparable and sharable between multiple care providers, health
      enterprises and standards-based Healthcare Information Technology (HIT).</para>
    <para>ANF can be used for multiple objectives. Examples of such objectives are:</para>

    </title>
    <para>In detailed clinical modeling there is a general approach shown in the figure below, that
      most standards have taken where there is a reference model which is then constrained with
      constraint models. In , the reference model and constraint model of various standards are
      shown. Additional information shown is the syntax used to describe the reference or constraint
      model, and if the standard is shaded grey, this symbolizes that clinical content is modeled in
      this part of the standard. </para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    <para>The reference model for the CEM standard is called the Abstract Instance Model. It is not
      formally defined with a syntax, but instead is defined in a specification which can then be
      implemented in various implementations such as java or xml. This reference model is very small
      and has no defined clinical content. Instead, clinical content is defined only in the
      constraint models of the CEM standard which are written in Clinical Element Modeling Language
      (CEML). </para>
    <para>The reference model for the CIMI v2 standard describes clinical content in both the
      reference and constraint models using the Archetype formalism developed by OpenEHR. The
      reference model is described in the Basic Meta-Model (BMM) using Object Data Instance Notation
      (ODIN) and the constraint models are described as Archetypes with Archetype Definition
      Language (ADL). </para>

    <para>"With the DCM approach the benefits of the two level modeling are respected and the
      enormous efforts that went into the clinical modeling efforts are also acknowledged. The idea
      dates back to 2007 where during a workshop, an overarching approach called Detailed Clinical
      Modeling emerged, using a term from Huff et al. [<link
        xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141130/#B1">1</link>]. This
      approach takes the commonalties of the various specifications to keep the conceptual
      descriptions and the logical models of data elements, code binding, relationships, data type
      specifications and such [<link
        xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141130/#B9">9</link>]. However, it
      does not go to the level of physical specification, and even, the logical model can easily be
      converted to reference model based approaches as Health Level 7 Reference Information Model
      (HL7 RIM) or OpenEHR or reference models.</para>
    <para>Due to the interoperability issues among these clinical modeling approaches and the
      investments already made, there currently is an approach trying to harmonize the existing
      work. This is carried out by the Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI). Their goal
      is to create a harmonized reference model for clinical knowledge models using both the ADL and
      UML formalisms. From these baseline formats, any kind of technical artifact can potentially be
      derived. CIMI also works on an EHR clinical model repository as open content. However, in
      practice, with all good intentions, CIMI has created yet another reference model and yet
      another dialect of ADL. Nevertheless, other initiatives seem to start picking these
      harmonization results up."</para>
