    <title>Introduction to Clinical Statements</title>
    
    <para>Clinical Statements are used to model all “entries” in a Clinical Document
        Architecture(CDA) document section. The Clinical Statement “Common Model Element Type”
        (CMET) is the base model for the all Consolidated CDA “clinical statement” templates that
        are still mandatory for Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendors. The concept of “clinical
        statement” is widely understood though there is an issue with consistency across HL7
        paradigms: V3, CDA, and FHIR.</para>

        <title>Normative HL7 V3 Clinical Statement Definition</title>
        <para>“An expression of a discrete item of clinical, clinically-related or public health
            information that is recorded because of its relevance to the care of a patient or other
            entity. Clinical or public health information can be expressed with different levels of
            granularity and therefore the extent and detail conveyed in a single statement may vary.
            To be regarded as a Clinical Statement, a concept must be associated with a patient or
            other entity in a manner which makes clear:</para>
