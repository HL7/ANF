                    Wikipedia [1]: Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating
                    a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a
                    separate concern.

&quot;Clearly, explained this way, this design principle is flawed because of regress to each individual symbol in the code.
"?>A
                    concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A
                    concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being
                    optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to
                    instantiate.<?oxy_comment_end?> A program that embodies SoC well is called a
                    modular program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by
                    encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined
                    interface.

With the drawback of hiding also certain assumptions that a potential re-user should be aware of to assess whether the module really does what it suggests it does.
"?>Encapsulation
                    is a means of information hiding.<?oxy_comment_end?> Layered designs in
                    information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g.,
                    presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).
                    The value of separation of concerns is simplifying development and maintenance
                    of computer programs. When concerns are well-separated, individual sections can
                    be reused, as well as developed and updated independently. Of special value is
                    the ability to later improve or modify one section of code without having to
                    know the details of the other sections, and without having to make corresponding
                    changes to those sections.</para>

Not sure I am following here as I am not sure about what ‘Laterality’ means here. I assume something with left side of the body and right side of the body. But to what extent? Limited to body parts that – in some meaning – come in pairs such as left thumbs and right thumbs? But no ‘laterality’ for heart (not even for patients with dextrocardia)? Is there a change in ‘laterality’ when somebody’s left kidney is transplanted to replace somebody else’s right kidney or a skin graft taken on the left put on a burn wound on the right? How does this interplay with ‘immutability’? Would ‘left kidney’ be an immutable class and would that prevent transplants of the sort just sketched?

Depends on what constitutes a ‘change’. Changing merely location, leaving everything else equal, does not change the object itself. If a database table is considered an object, it changes of course each time when some value in it is changed or a row added.

                    immutable object is something that cannot be changed after it is created, in

                <para>Although building immutable objects requires a bit more up-front complexity,
                    the downstream simplification forced by this abstraction easily offsets the
                    effort. One of the benefits of switching to a functional mindset is the
                    realization that tests exist to check that changes occur successfully in code.
                    In other words, testing’s real purpose is to validate mutation – and the more
                    mutation you have, the more testing is required to make sure you get it right.
                    If you isolate the places where changes occur by severely restricting mutation,

                    their composition (by containing those instances of other classes that implement

                <para>To favor composition over inheritance is a design principle that gives the

Why would ‘measurement’ be a single concern? Clearly, as indicated here, there are many subtypes. But then, even so clearly, ‘measurement’ is subtype of something else. What arguments do you have to place the ‘singularity’ at that level? This illustrates one of my qualms with the ‘separation of concern’ principle as indicated above.

Examples needed, although I would favor such an approach, one can’t argue that there is no ambiguity when a model is built such that disjointness of classes is to be asserted explicitly and when it isn’t, disjointness should not be assumed. Another issue is how this is impacted by temporality, e.g. ‘child’ and ‘adult’ are disjoint for human beings in the sense that at a time a human being is a child, it can’t be also an adult or the other way round. But cross time, every adult was at some earlier time a child. In the clinical notes of a longitudinal EHR the phrases ‘this child’ and ‘this adult’ may very well denote just one particular person.

Not just FHIR, but also CDMs like OMOP and PCORI are blundering in this way. Note that this criterion means that the different models not necessarily have the same structure, nor must rely on the same terminology, but that when you ‘look through’ each model+terminology, you are able to see the same reality at the same level of granularity. That means that both models and terminologies must be based on the same ontology.
"?>Patterns
                    should allow the consistent representation of information that is commonly
                    shared across models. For instance, attribution and participation information
                    should be captured consistently. Failure to do so forces implementers to develop
                    heuristics to capture and normalize attribution information that is represented
                    or extended differently in different classes (e.g., FHIR).</para>
