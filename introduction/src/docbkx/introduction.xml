  <title>A Normal Form for Clinical Statements</title>
  <para>A clinical <glossterm>statement</glossterm> is a definite and clear representation of a
    clinically-significant fact or situation that was observed to exist or happen. A clinical
    statement can be expressed as a <glossterm baseform="Narrative">narrative</glossterm> that
    provides a written account that can be naturally read by humans, as well as a <glossterm
      baseform="Normal Form">normal form</glossterm> which is a machine processable representation
    of the statement's data as a standardized and encoded fundamental form. There can be many views
    on what constitutes a normal form, based on differing use cases. Today, clinical statements are
    often represented in unpredictable and denormalized forms, which makes reliable and safe
    decision support challenging, and reduces the quality of other types of data processing. </para>
  <para>In this document, we present several different normal forms as background, and focus on the
    need for—and logical specification of—an <glossterm baseform="Analysis Normal Form">Analysis
      Normal Form (ANF)</glossterm>. ANF is a normal form intended to safely and reliably support
    data analysis.</para>

      However, both treatment and analysis of clinical statements require consistency not only at
      the format level (e.g. CDA, FHIR, V2) but also the content model (i.e. an instance of an <link

      only is there a potential for a lack of consistency with representing clinical statements with

      patient safety if a clinical statement is recorded and displayed differently across the
      continuum of care: Clinicians author clinical statements and enter them into their
      organization’s EHR systems as "Structured Clinical Input". This concept describes any data
      entry mechanism used by clinicians to record clinical statements. An instance of a clinical
      statement may be created using one or more forms. Vendors compete on usability for seamless
      Structured Clinical Input but, in some cases, structured clinical statements are based on
      standard-based models (e.g. CIMI, openEHR archetypes, etc.) but they may also be based on
      proprietary models. For the purposes of this document, the type or usability of data
      structures used for capture or display of clinical statements is not in scope. We assume that

      the various use cases. Maximum efficiency for each use case necessitates that any particular
      clinical information be available in multiple modeled forms. These models, although different
      in form, semantically represent the same information, and are known as isosemantic models. Any

        Interoperability Framework Canonical Definition (SAIF-CD). </para>
      <para>The SAIF-CD specification <citation>SAIF-CD</citation> defines three SAIF Perspectives:

        Object Management Group’s (OMG) levels-of-abstraction in Model-Driven Architecture (MDA)
        even though it reuses the same derivation. Therefore, the Implementable Perspective is
        derived from the Logical Perspective and the Logical Perspective is derived from the
        Conceptual Perspective. This approach ensures that any implementable artifacts (i.e. service
        specifications, implementation guides) are traceable to business/clinical requirements and
        logical models of knowledge.</para>

        closely aligns with an MDA analogue.</para>

        <title>Conceptual Perspective</title>
        <para> These artifacts are most commonly focused on the “Problem-Space” rather than the

        <para>A fully-specified Conceptual Perspective thus should be both readable and traceable by
          Domain Experts and Subject Matter Experts and rigorous enough to serve as input into the
          development in the Logical Perspective.</para>
        <para>In HL7, the Conceptual Perspective is represented by Domain Analysis Models (DAMs) and
          business models that represent stakeholder requirements analyzed by SMEs and DEs. This
          perspective that precede the development of either logical or implantable artifacts and
          it’s a key to successful testing of implementations. </para>

      <section>
        <title>Logical Perspective</title>
        <para>Artifacts in the Logical Perspective represent traceable translations of
          Conceptual-level artifacts into a form and format, usable by and useful to architects and
          “inward-facing analysts.” Also included are additional specification materials required by
          architects preparing artifacts for consumption by developers. </para>
        <para>There are no definite boundaries between the Logical and Implementable Perspectives.
          Therefore, it’s important for organizations such as HL7 to standardize logical models used
          to generate/create implementable artifacts (i.e. implementation guides, profiles, and
          templates). CIMI Clinical Statements, <link
            xlink:href="https://www.iso.org/standard/62416.html">ISO/TS 13972:2015</link> Detailed

        <title>Implementable Perspective</title>
        <para>Artifacts in the Implementable Perspective are typically defined by developers or

          system integrators. Note that the artifacts in the Implementable Perspective are not
          actual implementations, but rather implementable in a number of implementation instances.
          Thus, all the necessary technical bindings, including data types, value sets, class
          libraries, and interface specifications are part of the Implementable Perspective. FHIR
          implementation requires a combination of profiles and test cases to ensure that
          implementations meet the requirements used to derive the conceptual and logical
