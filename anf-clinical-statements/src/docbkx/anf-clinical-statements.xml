    <para>In the context of the ANF Model, a clinical statement represents an entry in the patient
        record that documents, in a structured/computable manner, clinical information related to
        the patient that is asserted by a particular source, recorded, and potentially verified. </para>
    <para>As seen in the CIMI Clinical Statements section, clinical information related to the
        patient can be entered and stored in an EMR in multiple different ways. ANF strives to
        standardize the structure of clinical statements to eliminate the disparity of clinical
        information by limiting the design choices a clinical modeler must make. ANF can then act as
        a consistent transformation target for the multiple differing clinical information
        representations that currently exist, making this clinical information more easily
        computable and eliminating the need to create multiple ways to analyze the same data.</para>

Such family history is clinically relevant but is not a characteristic of the patient. I suggest to make this a 3rd type of clinical statement. If you insist on classifying statements based on what they are about, then you would have (1) statements which describe the patient as a whole, any part of him, or any entities that depend on him or his parts (qualities, realizables, processes in which he or his parts participate); (2) statements about requests for actions that once executed will results in statements of type 1 or type 3, and (3) statements about clinically relevant phenomena that occurred or have occurred in his environment but are not about the patient himself.
