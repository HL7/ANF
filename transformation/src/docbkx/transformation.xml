        <title> Transformation</title>
        <para>ANF seeks to simplify the complexity that currently exists in clinical statement
            models.  ANF provides a normal form for clinical information captured using any approach
            to data entry using either standard-based logical models (e.g. CIMI, DCM, etc.) or
            proprietary data entry approaches (See “Structured Clinical Statement” section). ANF
            helps transform clinical data into normalized data that can then be used to: </para>

        </para>
        <para>Clinical data will start off overly post-coordinated but with the data potentially
            spread across multiple fields. By creating an ANF statement, one can take the disparate
            information and organize it so that the post-coordination is mostly contained in the
            topic representation instead of being spread across disparate fields. For instance,
            there may be 1 clinical statement in an EHR for blood pressure measurement and care
            planning that might be 5 observations when represented by FHIR. There are many different
            ways to create the FHIR data structures. Redundancy in representation of clinical
            statmenets may cause insertion, deletion and, maintenance of anomalies. </para>
        <para>Normalization of clinical statements is defined by Elkin as "the ability to identify
            every representational format that confers the same meaning as being equivalent (i.e.,
            unambiguous representation). Currently, there are three basic categories of errors that
            might be associated with attempts at normalizing clinical statement represenation. The
            first is error assosicated with normalization of content of the terminology; the second
            is error associated with normalization of the semantics of the terminology; and, third
            is errors that result from ambiguous or misleading interaction between the structured
            clinical input and presentation of compound terminology to clinician end-users. </para>
        <para>A current solution to minimize the variation of representing clinical statements is by
            using rules that protect against unrecognized ambiguity. Rules are created and
            documented by various healthcare organizations and aim to help modelers in making
            choices related to compostional grammar rules and to adhere to modeling "style guides".
            For instance, a common style guide choice in the CIMI Clinical Statement model is to
            either use the Assertion style or the Evaluation Result style. When transferring data
            structures between and amongst institutions, these different styles may be a problem.
            The current approach is to solve the problem by conformity rather than with technology.
            Normalization implies the ability to recognize all representations that express the same
            meaning as being algorithimically equivalent.

        <para>With ANF, we aim to reduce the ambiguity and redundancy in model representation of
            clincial statements. ANF
            <?oxy_comment_start author="timowilliams" timestamp="20190522T215723-0500" comment="Where do concrete domains fit in?"?>will
            be able to handle concrete domains by increasing the payload in the topic representation
            and by putting all of the topic details in a post-coordinated SNOMED CT expression.
            <?oxy_comment_end?>By using the ANF model, with the increased specificity of the topic
            expression, the variability in representations is reduced since the CIMI Evaluation
            Result style representation of clinical data is eliminated..

            ANF, the things that change meaning are always in the topic.<?oxy_comment_end?> Whether
            something is a request or has occurred – this is not in the topic. That separation is

        <para>With ANF, we are cutting down the choices modelers will have to make, but we do not
            eliminate all the choices. There may still be more than 1 way to represent things in ANF
            and therefore there are the following editorial rules that we recommend to promote
            conformity amongst modelers: <?oxy_comment_start author="rcholan" timestamp="20190523T005636-0400" comment="Note from Keith: For the ANF document, we should somewhere describe assumptions about what an ANF implementation requires. For example, ANF requires an ability to classify topic expressions (and expressions that may go in other locations). Maybe a section that describes the requirements of a &quot;mapping&quot; based system with a plethora of statement models, and then what ANF requires above and beyond a mapping system, and what the benefits are.

        <para>The following diagram highlights how clinical statements recorded using a model of
            knowledge (e.g. CIMI model or archetype) are used to enter information that may be
            exchanged using a variety of interoperability artifacts (e.g. HL7 V2 messages, CDA
            documents, FHIR resources). If the information is aggregated and normalized for
            analysis, the ANF clinical statement may be used to extract/query normalized clinical
            statements using ANF-based FHIR template. The diagram illustrates the role each SAIF-CD

        <para>Normal forms are commonly used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables.
            ANF can have similar benefits on clinical data storage and retrieval:</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">1. First Normal Form</emphasis></para>
        <para>If a relation contain composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates first normal
            form or a relation is in first normal form if it does not contain any composite or
            multi-valued attribute. A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that
            relation is singled valued attribute.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">2. Second Normal Form</emphasis></para>
        <para>To be in second normal form, a relation must be in first normal form and relation must
            not contain any partial dependency. A relation is in 2NF iff it has No Partial
            Dependency, i.e., no non-prime attribute (attributes which are not part of any candidate
            key) is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table.</para>
