    <title>Clinical Input Form</title>
    <para>Ideally, the way the information is presented to clinicians is in a manner that is most
        efficient for the clinicians to use. However, what is an efficient way for clinicians to
        select and enter data may not be the most efficient way for data analysts to use when they
        are querying data once it has been normalized and stored in a database, such as when
        creating a new CDS rule or compiling prevalence statistics. For this, the data is normalized
        using the <emphasis role="italic">Analysis Normal Form (ANF) </emphasis>and stored in a
        database. Again, the ANF is not necessarily a physical structure, but is how a data analyst
        might see the data when they are looking at it in a database, and not as clinicians would
        see it in the user interface (i.e., CIF).</para>
    <para> </para>
    <para>Clinician collects data ð Clinical Input Form</para>
    <para>Data is normalized ð Transformation process from CIF to ANF ð Representable/storable in
        multiple types of databases, </para>
    <para>Dataanalyst who is using or querying the data (e.g., creating a CDS rule or working on
        prevalence statistics) ð ANF (it is how the data is represented or stored in the database;
        must know enough about the data to know what is stored in the topic vs. what is stored as a
        result or detail)</para>
    <para> </para>
    <para>Thegoal of ANF is to enable analysts to understand the data and how it is stored in lieu
        of having to teach them about the thousands of ways data can exist within an isosemantic
        family (i.e., CIF) and ensure the data that has to be expressed can be expressed in an
        operable and scalable way. The more that data is
        normalized, the simpler it will become to analyze, and the likelihood of analysis errors
        will be reduced. Without the ANF, the probability of patient safety risks is increased.
        Examples of problems that can occur are:</para>
    <para> </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">An inability</emphasis> to determine that two clinical statements
        are equivalent</para>
    <para>Taking two 250 mg acetaminophen tablets is the same as taking one 500 mg tablet but the analyst only queries for one of the statements, not
        both.</para>
    <para>Presenceof dot blot hemorrhage and 2 dot blot hemorrhages observed are equalin regard to
        presence and absence but the analyst queries only for
        presence vs. a quantitative finding of dot blot hemorrhages.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">An inability </emphasis>to express something that is clinically
        significant</para>
    <para>Wemay not be able to express chest pain on inspiration,
        whichcan be a sign of pleurisy. The ability to differentiate cardiac chest pain from other
        types of chest pain is clinically important. An example of something that needs to be
        represented is <emphasis role="italic">chestpain that worsens when you breathe, cough, or
            sneeze</emphasis>.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">An error is made</emphasis> in recording or in querying a repository
        for clinical statements</para>
    <para>On October 1, 2016, a provider enters a medication order for acetaminophen 250 mg for a
        patientto take 1 tablet twice daily for 2 days starting October 1, 2016</para>
    <para>CIF: Provider enters the medication order</para>
    <para>ANF: Analyst creates a CDS rule to identify all patients ordered acetaminophen during
        theperiod September 1 – December 31, 2016. However, while the analyst creates a query to
        search for a clinical statement (i.e., Request) where acetaminophen was the direct substance
        and was ordered during the period September 1 – December 31, 2016, the analyst did not
        include a Request topic of “Administration of drug or medication PO BID for pain.” Thus, the
        medication order would not be included in the query results.</para>
