    <title>Measure and Result</title>
    <para>A unique aspect of the ANF Model is that all measures and results are numeric ranges. The
        hierarchy of classes to represent these is shown in Figure 10,
            “Result Hierarchy”. An important point to notice in this class diagram is that
        the ANF Model does not allow coded results, only a numeric interval is possible. </para>

        <title>Measure </title>
        <para>Measure captures measurable elements of clinical statements , e.g. the results of test procedures, time periods, frequencies of repetitions
            for procedures or medication administrations. Note that the inherited attributes from
            the Interval class will be discussed here.</para>

    <section>
        <title>lowerBound</title>
        <para/>
        <para>Lowerbound represents the lower bound of a measurableelement. This can be the lower bound of a range: For the “Administration of 25 to 50 mg
            of medication X” the lower bound is 25. For a test result, which is not a range, lower
            and upper bound are the same. Example: systolic blood pressure 110 mmHg. The lower and
            upper bound are both 110 mmHg.</para>

    <section>
        <title>upperBound</title>
        <para> </para>
        <para/>
        <para>Upper bound represents the upper bound of a measurable element. This can be the upper
            boundary of a range: For the “Administration of 25 to 50 mg of medication X” the upper
            bound is 50 mg. In cases, where the measurable element does not represent a range, upper
            and lower bound have the same value.</para>
        <para> </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>includeLowerBound</title>
        <para> </para>
        <para>Includelower bound states whether the lower bound in the interval is included in the
            interval. In the medication examples above, the lower bound would be included. The lower
            range dose of 25 mg of medication X dose can be administered.</para>
        <para>Theinclusion or exclusion of lower bound is needed to express measurable elements
            which include relative properties, such as “greater than”, “less than” and others.
            Example: “Persistent cough for more than 10 days”. If a lower bound of “10” is chosen,
            it would not be included, because the example states: <emphasis role="underline"
                >more</emphasis> than 10 days. Choosing “11” would require to include the lower
            bound.</para>
        <para> </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>includeUpperBound</title>
        <para> </para>
        <para>Include upper bound states whether the upper bound in the interval is included in the
            interval. Similar to lower bound, where the measurable element has relative properties,
            the same rules apply. If the upper bound of a measure is not defined, e.g. “blood
            glucose measurement daily for at least 2 weeks”, the upper bound will be captured as
            “inf” (infinite). Infinite as an upper bound is never included.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Resolution</title>
        <para> </para>
        <para>TheResolution within a measure defines the possible or allowed increments in which the
            measured “thing” can be counted. In the example of the systolic blood pressure of 110
            mmHg, the resolution is “1”, because the blood pressure measurement result can be
            counted in 1 mmHg increments. The Resolution is not always defined or known. Example: a
            clinical statement like “History of breast cancer” implies an undefined amount of time
            in the past and it is not stated, if it is years, months, etc.</para>
        <para> </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>measureSemantic</title>
        <para> </para>
        <para>Measure semantic represents the unit of measure. It is described using a logical
            expression. In systolic bloodpressure, the unit of measure is millimeters of mercury,
            and thus the measure semantic is a SNOMED CT concept: 259018001 |Millimeter of mercury
            (qualifier value). For blood glucose measurement daily for 2 weeks, the measure semantic
            would be “258705008 |week (qualifier value)”. In cases where the measure pertains to
            something relative to the statement time, as in the example above of “History of breast
            cancer” the standardized time/date format ISO 8601 is used for the measure semantic: ISO
            8601 prior to statement time.</para>

        <para>Intervention Result is a result, thus inheriting all the attributes of Result, and
            adds the attribute <emphasis role="italic">status</emphasis>, which is a coded value
            representing the current status of the intervention.</para>

        <para> </para>
        <para> Observation Result is a result, thus inheriting all the attributes of Result, and
            adds the attributes <emphasis role="italic">healthRisk </emphasis>and <emphasis
                role="italic">normalRange</emphasis>. Health Risk is used to flag a result with
            coded values such as 'low', 'normal', high', and 'critical'. Normal Range is the
            interval of values that are normal.</para>
