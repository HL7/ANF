This zip file contains new and updated XSL files for Informatics
DocBook documentation. 

docbook.xsl                - PDF customizations.
docbook-html-chunk.xsl     - HTML chunking behavior customizations.
docbook-html-elements.xsl  - HTML element customizations.
docbook-common.xsl         - Code shared between PDF and HTML outputs.


Features
------------

1.  Adds support for <editorial-rule> and <requirement> elements,
formatting them like <example>.  

2.  Numbers the new elements separately.

3.  Generates a "List of" in the TOC for each of these.

4.  Numbers sections.

5.  Removes "Chapter" label from the chapter title page.

6.  For PDF output, starts new chapters on an odd page.


Installation
---------------
Before using these files, the xsl:import statements that
reference the stock DocBook files must be updated.  They
currently have relative paths, but these should be replaced with
URNs and new entries in the XML catalog file that Informatics
uses to map the URNs to file paths.

Usage
-----------
docbook.xsl 
   Use this to generate FO output suitable for processing
   with FOP or other XSL-FO processor.  I did not set 
   the fop1.extensions param in the stylesheet, because I wasn't
   sure what XSL-FO processor you are using.  If you will only
   use FOP, then put the parameter setting in the stylesheet.
   Otherwise, set the extensions param appropriate for the XSL-FO
   processor on the command line.

docbook-html-chunk.xsl
   Use this to generate chunked HTML output. You should set the
   'base.dir' param on the command line to put the HTML output in
   a separate directory.  You can style the HTML output most
   efficiently with a CSS file.

docbook-html-elements.xsl
   You can use this stylesheet directly to generate
   a single-page HTML output file. It is imported by
   docbook-html-chunk.xsl.
