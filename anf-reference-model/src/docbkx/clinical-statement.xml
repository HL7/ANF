    <para>Clinical Statement is the main class which describes an entry of clinical information into
        the patient record. Most importantly it contains the 'topic' which describes what this
        statement is about, and the 'circumstance' which will contain either request or result
        information regarding the 'topic'.</para>
    <section>
        <title>statementTime</title>
        <para>statementTime describes when the statement was documented in ISO 8601 Date/Time

        <title>subjectOfRecordId</title>
        <para>A patient's clinical record will contain many statements. The subjectOfRecordId is a
            uuid which identifies the patient clinical record in which this statement is contained.
            If this statement is in John Doe's patient record, then John Doe is the subject of
            record and the subjectOfRecordId is a uuid that identifies John Doe. </para>

        <para>statementAuthor is an optional list of authoring participants. Either a Participant or
            its subclass IdentifiedParticipant can be used. Participant includes a coded <emphasis
                role="italic">participantRole </emphasis>for values such as 'Healthcare
            professional', 'Nurse', or 'Requestor'. IdentifiedParticipant adds the additional

            identify the participant.</para>

        <title>subjectOfInformation</title>
        <para>subjectOfInformation is a coded field used to express <emphasis role="bold">WHO

            statements not only about the patient, but also statements about children, relatives and
            donors. Thus, some possible values for subjectOfInformation, would include codes for
            'subject of record' (the patient), 'family member', or 'donor'. The majority of
            statements will have a subjectOfInformation with a value of 'subject of record', since
            most statements in a patient record will be about the patient.</para>

        <title>statementType</title>
        <para>statementType distinguishes between a performance ('performed') and a request
            ('requested'). Performances may be observational performances, e.g. the observation of a
            clinical finding or disorder being present or absent. They can also be a procedure or
            intervention which has been performed on the subject of record in the past, e.g. “a
            procedure using a 12-lead electrocardiogram”. Performances can – but do not have to –
            include quantitative or qualitative results, e.g. “3 dot blot hemorrhages” or “Hepatitis
            A antibody positive”.</para>

This comment is written after I made other comments on assertions in section 1.6.10. Although I get, I think, the gist, this entire section – and actually the entire larger section 1.6 – is unclear because of insufficient distinction between what is description and what the description is about. Section 1.6’s title is ‘clinical statement components’ and the impression is given that the components are listed one by one in the subsections. The main problem I have is that there is not explicit enough distinction between what is on the side of the patient – e.g. a tumor – and what is on the side of documentation thereof, i.e. what a clinical statement should be, f.i. ‘observation of tumor’, ‘removal of tumor’, … Now are ‘clinical statement components’ strictly components of descriptions or does it include components of the patient itself? If it is only on the side of the description, is it to be taken as a literal part of the description, does it include implicit components that are identified in certain linguistic theories about term formation (e.g. case grammar, case theory, …). Most essential to get clear is what ‘topic’ exactly stands for.

You don’t mean that just the phrase ‘stress echocardiogram’ is a request for action? It could as well be an observation that it was done.

But surely you should disambiguate between the phenomena themselves and the observations thereof. Plus be more precise about what ‘observation’ exactly is, otherwise you get trapped in HL7-nonsense. Clearly, you can only observe phenomena that are there: you can only observe congestive heart failure in a patient when it is there. But you can state in a record that the patient has CHF without he having it. In such case, the clinician might believe he observed an instance of CHF, but he did not observe it. Furthermore, ‘observe’ should not be overloaded with ‘deduce’. You can’t observe ‘psychosis’, only deduce it on the basis of …

This is unclear. Is the topic part of the assertion, or is it that what (part of) the assertion is about? If it is what the assertion is about, it cannot have clarity of meaning. If the topic is the patient’s CHF, what would be the clarity of meaning of his disease? Is it the assertion, then do you mean that instances of the specified type must exist (perhaps not in this patient), or that it must be able to exist in the patient (thus accounting for mistakes, misdiagnosis, …)?

Lack of distinction between the observation as an action and that what is observed leads to ambiguity about whether an absent observed finding is an assertion about whether, for example, a requested observation was not done, or whether it was done but there was nothing to observe.

Ironically, this is one of the few things that IS clear to me. It should describe the circumstances which are conditions for the requested action to be performed, ‘when awake’, ‘after breakfast’, ‘if x still present after 3 days’, …Main issue is not to confuse it with the WHEN although many triggers can be expressed as such and not to leave anything implicit: e.g. if a trigger is ‘after breakfast’ doesit mean that if pt did not have breakfast it shouldn’t happen?  What is not clear, however, is how to squeeze such distinctions with enough clarity in formal expressions.

Brings in another level of confusion: I thought this entire discussion was about documenting what is on the side of the patient, here you include documenting how clinical statements are configured. That might be valid too, and I would even recommend it for quality control purposes, but then an extra meta-level needs to be included.
