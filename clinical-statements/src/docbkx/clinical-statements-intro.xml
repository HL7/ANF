        <title>Clinical Statement Definition</title>
        <para>A <emphasis role="italic">clinical statement</emphasis> represents an entry in the
            patient record that documents in a structured/computable manner clinical information
            about a subject of information, such as a patient or a relative of the patient, and that
            is asserted by a particular source, recorded, and potentially verified. In a general
            sense, a clinical statement is any statement about a subject of record, e.g. the
            patient, made by healthcare provider, e.g. a nurse or a physician. This can be the
            statement of a condition being present, a request for a procedure to be done, the
            results of lab tests or the patient’s family history of cancer. There are a number of
            implementations which fit this description, e.g. the current normative definition of
            Clinical Statements in HL7 V3 describes principles and constraints for Clinical
            Statements. <footnote>

        <para>Clinical Statements are used to model all “entries” in a Clinical Document
            Architecture (CDA) document section. The Clinical Statement “Common Model Element Type”
            (CMET) is the base model for the all Consolidated CDA “clinical statement” templates
            that are still mandatory for Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendors. The concept of
            “clinical statement” is widely understood though there is an issue with consistency
            across HL7 paradigms: V3, CDA, and FHIR.

        <para>Let's consider the following example for blood pressure measurement and the clinical
            statement that may be entered to represent this information.</para>
        <para>“Systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, taken on right brachial artery, using adult size
            blood pressure cuff, patient in sitting position for at least 5 minutes, urinated no
            more than 30 minutes prior to measurement”. For the user, this would be the easiest way
            to document the measurement. However, the various parts of information about the body
            site, the blood pressure cuff, patient position etc. would be lost to any attempt of
            data retrieval. Rather than selecting this information all at once with a single item,
            the user could choose the various parts of information pertinent to the blood pressure
            measurement in various ways. </para>

        <title>Clinical Input Statements</title>
        <para>Clinicians author clinical statements and enter them into their organization’s EHR
            systems. Clinical statements can be expressed and documented in many different ways in
            EHR systems, where Clinical Input Forms provide different options to document the same
            clinical statement. These differences pose challenges for data retrieval, data analysis
            and data analysts in their attempts to extract accurate clinical analysis results. </para>
        <para>Clinicians enter clinical statements into their organization’s
            EHR<?oxy_comment_start author="kmaulden" timestamp="20190423T095907-0400" comment="Joey Coyle:
We need a better term than CIF, as Classic CIMI is not CIF. Classic CIMI is as post-coordinated as is reasonable for the purpose of making queries and analysis easier.  A clinical input form is the opposite and is usually as pre-coordinated as is reasonable. During data input, these pre-coordinated instances would then need to be transformed to a post-coordinated form before being stored in a repository.

The main problem is that both ANF and highly post-coordinated models are for analysis.  ANF may be more reproducibly consistent and better for analysis, but to assert that CIMI models are designed to aid in clinical input is an error.

This should be decided sooner than later.

The big difference I see is that ANF has a pure and consistent coded topic with a numerical result, whereas Classic Cimi can have a complex structured tree of codes for parts of the topic and/or the result, where positioning in the tree may imply semantic meaning.

Maybe…
Structured Coded Form

In CIMI we allow expression tree both in topic and in the value, which creates problem like the dot blot hemorrhages. We should get 1 or two examples of statements and how ANF uses it, how CIMI uses it and what it looks like in CIF. Let this emerge through worked examples. We need to explain, how ANF is different from CIMI. Need example of what “classic CIMI” is. Add to BP and Pulse example one more that has a non-numeric result." parentID="hhx_wxf_nhb"?>
            typically in a manner that we call here the clinical input form (CIF). However, the CIF
            is not a literal form<?oxy_comment_end?><?oxy_comment_end mid="4"?> that clinicians
            select and enter data in. Rather, it refers to the manner in which information is
            presented to the clinicians and how they enter the data, such as by constraining the
            information to allow only certain values to be entered, e.g. through a drop-down list or
            radio button, or breaking up large chunks of related information into smaller

        <title>Analysis Clinical Statements</title>
        <para>Ideally, the way the information is presented to clinicians is in a manner that is
            most efficient for the clinicians to use. The ways in which data is entered determines
            how data is stored in the EHR databases. However, what is an efficient way for
            clinicians to select and enter data may not be the most efficient way for data analysts
            to use when they are querying data once it has been normalized and stored in a database,
            such as when creating a new clinical decision support rule or compiling prevalence
            statistics. For this, the data should be normalized using an <emphasis role="italic"
                >analysis normal form (ANF)</emphasis> and stored in a database in such a way to
            optimize retrieval. The ANF is not necessarily a physical structure, but is how a data
            analyst might see the data when they are looking at it in a database, and not as
            clinicians would see it in the user interface (i.e., CIF).</para>

        <para>The goal of ANF is to enable analysts to understand the data and how it is stored in
            lieu of having to teach them about the thousands of ways data can be entered (i.e., CIF)
            and ensure the data that has to be expressed, can be expressed in an operable and
            scalable way. The more that data is normalized, the simpler it will become to analyze,
            and the likelihood of analysis errors will be reduced. Without the ANF, the probability
            of patient safety risks is increased.</para>
