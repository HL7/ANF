    <para> This paper will describe an approach to the transformation of detailed clinical models
        from the Clinical Element Model (CEM) standard to the Clinical Information Modeling
        Initiative (CIMI) version 2 standard. CIMI is currently a working group within Health Level
        Seven (HL7). The CEM models used as the source for the translation will be provided by
        Intermountain Healthcare. </para>
    <para> In detailed clinical modeling there is a general approach shown in <xref
            linkend="reference_constraint_0135"/>, that most standards have taken where there is a
        reference model which is then constrained with constraint models. The reference model
        and constraint model of various standards are shown. Additional information shown is the
        syntax used to describe the reference or constraint model, and if the standard is shaded
        grey, this symbolizes that clinical content is modeled in this part of the standard. </para>

    <para> The reference model for the CEM standard is called the Abstract Instance Model. It is not
        formally defined with a syntax, but instead is defined in a specification which can then be
        implemented in various implementations such as java or xml. This reference model is very
        small and has no defined clinical content. Instead, clinical content is defined only in the
        constraint models of the CEM standard which are written in Clinical Element Modeling
        Language (CEML). </para>
    <para> The reference model for the CIMI v2 standard describes clinical content in both the
        reference and constraint models using the Archetype formalism developed by OpenEHR. The
        reference model is described in the Basic Meta-Model (BMM) using Object Data Instance
        Notation (ODIN) and the constraint models are described as Archetypes with Archetype
        Definition Language (ADL). </para>
