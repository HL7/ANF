    <para>(3) insufficient standardization of CDS integration mechanisms; </para>
    <para>(4) a need to align with broader standardization initiatives. </para>
    <para>One of the reasons that CDS interventions are difficult to implement between health care
      systems is because disparate EHR systems and health care systems utilize different underlying
      patient data models and clinical statement representation mechanisms. Even distinct
      instantiations of use of the same EHR systems differ in how they encode patient data and in
      how they represent clinical statements. The ONC and NAM report states that "[b]ecause CDS
      relies on inferencing using patient data, this heterogeneity in patient data representation
      poses an immense obstacle to sharing CDS."

    <para>ANF aims to reduce the variability of clincial data inputted into EHR systems and
      modeled/stored in data repositories. The standardization of clinical observations in a manner
      that supports automated processing requires a formal clinical statement model, such as ANF.
      The most important requirements of such a statement model are that (1) it can represent any
      clinician-specified observation accurately and precisely and (2) it can support automated
      query and retrieval operations correctly and efficiently.</para>
    <para>ANF aims to reduce the variability of how clinical data within the value sets and clinical
      decision rules managed by EHR systems and modeled/stored in data repositories. For example, a
      clinician could document that a patient has “bacterial pneumonia caused by
      methicillin-resistant Staph. Aureus” by combining the pre-existing concept “bacterial
      pneumonia” with the pre-existing concept “Methicillin Resistant Staph. Aureus” and specifying
      that the latter is the “causative agent” of the former. The patient’s medical record would
      then contain an entry consisting of the following expression: </para>
    <para>Bacterial Pneumonia (ConceptID = 53084003) : Causative Agent (ConceptID=246075003) =
      Methicillin Resistant Staph. Aureus (ConceptID=115329001)</para>
    <para>If specified correctly, post-coordinated expressions also support subsumption testing.
      Hence, the patient whose record contains the expression above would also be identified by the
      query “find all patients with a diagnosis of any infectious disease (Infectious Disease :
      ConceptID = 40733004) in their record.”</para>

    <title>Implications on Population Health</title>
    <para>Electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) and CDS alerts are triggered by clinical data
      that is represented in data repositories by clinical statements represented by detailed
      clinical models with data elements encoded by standards-based clinical terminologies. Because
      these measures and alerts intend to promote evidence-based clinical processes, variations in
      clinical data caused by having inaccurate, incomplete, or antiquated implementations of
      underlying logical models may impact the ability of clinicians to assess care and improve
      quality. Jean-Jacques et al. showed that health information technology-supported quality
      improvement (QI) initiatives can decrease disparities for some chronic disease management and
      preventive measures
        QI.<?oxy_comment_start author="Ioana" timestamp="20190726T135203-0400" comment="Ref..." flag="done"?><citation>Jean</citation><?oxy_comment_end?>
      Data-driven QI efforts rely heavily on patient-level data generated by eCQM reports or CDS
      alerts, which are dependent upon standards-based encoded clinical data. If clinicians rely on
      inaccurate implementations of eCQMs and CDS, then they may have lists/alerts with patients
      intended to be excluded from a measure/alert, and may therefore, target inappropriate patients
      for therapies, such as recommending aspirin use for someone at high-risk for a fatal bleeding
      event. Similarly, life-saving treatment may be denied or
      delayed.<?oxy_comment_start author="timowilliams" timestamp="20190717T183701-0500" comment="From Stephanie K.

      Number-Needed-to- Treat (NNT) statistics show that of patients with known cardiovascular risk

      harmed by a major bleeding event. An implementation study

      against clinical data from two primary care clinics shows that 121 (92%) of the patients were
      inappropriately included in a measure’s denominator. These patients were also taking an
      anticoagulant medication, so the Number-Needed-to-Harm (NNH) statistic for this subset of
      patients for aspirin usage is likely much higher, and for this study, 1 to 2 people may have
      been harmed if the inaccurate implementation persisted, as evidence shows that patients with
      combinations of aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel are associated with up to a three-fold
      higher risk of bleeding for patients on dual therapy and triple therapy. With another measure
      for statin therapy, 1 in 21 people have a repeat heart attack, stroke or death avoided, so
      even 10 missed people have significant risk of events. Similarly, 10% are harmed by muscle
      damage or pain, or ~1 of the 14 inappropriately included in the study.

      with data from two primary care clinics, failure to include or exclude patients could have led
      to real harm. </para>
    <para>With eCQM implementation and QI infrastructure increasing, the problem of having, and
      using, inaccurate eCQM implementations or CDS implementations could have significant potential
      negative impact on population health by not avoiding events and avoiding harms for patients.
      ANF reduces these erroneous implementations. Without a precise logical model for clinical data
      like ANF, comparability of eCQMs for payment programs and utility of CQM data for targeted
      quality improvement may be limited.</para>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <para>In conclusion, Analysis Normal Form (ANF) presents a simple reproducible approach to
      modeling clinical statements specifically for data analysis. It reduces clinical statements to
      two types, Performance of an action, finding, or observation and Request for Action, both
      clinical statement types with topics. ANF is compatible with other work in statement
      representation models such as the CIMI Clinical Statement approach, with its focus on more
      traditional complex structured trees, whereas ANF focuses on structuring data in a way CDS
      systems can extract data in an unambiguous way. ANF provides a single, normatlized, form for
      clinical statements that may be used to create assertional or prcoedural knowledge articacts
      as clinical decision support</para>
