For example, ANF requires an ability to classify topic expressions (and expressions that may go in other locations). Maybe a section that describes the requirements of a &quot;mapping&quot; based system with a plethora of statement models, and then what ANF requires above and beyond a mapping system, and what the benefits are. 
Re-using some of the work in the interoperability paper is probably wise. I think a distillation of key concepts should be part of the HL7 ballot document. We need to motivate why an ANF approch is necessary as opposed to the status quo.

    <title> Background
      <?oxy_comment_start author="rcholan" timestamp="20190529T235034-0400" comment="RC Suggestion: We should probably mention that there is a goal to normalize data in a high reliability framework in mind. "?></title><?oxy_comment_end?>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Analysis Normal Form</emphasis> (ANF) is a logical model intended to
      represent a <emphasis role="bold">normalized</emphasis> view of aggregate clinical statements
      for analysis, research, clinical decision support, and other purposes. ANF can be used to
      represent any isosemantic clinical statements irrespective of how the information was captured
      at its source (i.e. information systems or medical devices). ANF could be used in conjunction
      with other models intended to ensure that clinical information is structured and complete at
      the time of entry (e.g. CIMI models, Detailed Clinical Models) or exchanged among systems
      (e.g. HL7 CDA templates, HL7 V2 message profiles, FHIR profiles). </para>
    <para>Clinicians, integrators , and researcher face different priorities, forcing trade-offs to
      be made that optimize data entry brevity at the cost of computability. ANF represents a
      collection of patterns and approaches to provide predictable transformations between sets of
      models can be optimized for clinical input and models that are optimized for computability
      through normalization. The more normalized the data is, the simpler it will become to analyze,
      and errors will be reduced. Post-coordinated compositional statements using ANF introduce the
      ability to faithfully expand from a reduced form or compare to other statements with ease and
      no loss of semantic integrity. Elkin wrote about what is needed in order for post coordinated
      statements to be comparable and captured one of ANF's key objectives: "to be <emphasis
        role="bold">a formal terminological composition and decomposition mechanism</emphasis> for
      lossless information representation such that both explicit and implicit information can be
      faithfully recovered, maintained, and modified with ease." (Elkin, pg 14) </para>
    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">main purpose</emphasis> of ANF is providing a normalized
      representation of clinical statements from heterogeneous source using an objective
      quantitative <emphasis role="bold">measure</emphasis> to help evaluate the result, presence,
      and magnitude of a specific finding, request or observation.</para>
    <para> ANF requires an ability to classify topic expressions (and expressions that may go in
      other locations) and thus it depends either on systems that on systems that can produce
      structured information reducible to ANF. These systems may create normal data natively or
      transform other representations of clinical statements (e.g. C-CDA templates, FHIR profiles)
      to normal form - ANF.</para>
    <para>Overall, ANF allows healthcare enterprises to normalize information aggregated across
      multiple sources to better support a set of analysis </para>

        <para>To augment the HL7 Version 2 and Version 3 representations, HL7 introduced an
          architecture to allow for a clear separation of concerns among interoperability models and
          specification from the abstract or conceptual to the most precise, implementable, and
          testable that ensures semantic interoperability.</para>
        <para>SAIF-CD specification <citation>SAIF-CD</citation> defines three SAIF Perspectives:
          Conceptual, Logical, and Implementable. These perspective are not formally equivalent with
          Object Management Group’s (OMG) levels-of-abstraction in Model-Driven Architecture (MDA)
          even though it reuses the same derivation. Therefore, the Implementable Perspective is
          derived from the Logical Perspective and the Logical Perspective is derived from the
          Conceptual Perspective. This approach ensures that any implementable artifacts (i.e.
          service specifications, implementation guides) are traceable to business/clinical
          requirements and logical models of knowledge.</para>

        <para>However, the SAIF Conceptual Perspective is not completely equivalent to the MDA
          concept of Computationally Independent Model (CIM), the Logical Perspective is not
          equivalent to the MDA Platform Independent Model (PIM), nor is the Implementable
          Perspective equivalent to the MDA Platform Specific Model although this Perspective is the
          SAIF Perspective that most closely aligns with an MDA analogue.</para>
        <section>
          <title>Conceptual Perspective</title>
          <para> These artifacts are most commonly focused on the “Problem-Space” rather than the
            “Solution Space,” and contain explicit, unambiguous descriptions of the various
            dimensions of the component (e.g. clinical statement) or system being specified. </para>
          <para>A fully-specified Conceptual Perspective thus should be both readable and traceable
            by Domain Experts and Subject Matter Experts and rigorous enough to serve as input into
            the development in the Logical Perspective.</para>
          <para>In HL7, the Conceptual Perspective is represented by Domain Analysis Models (DAMs)
            and business models that represent stakeholder requirements analyzed by SMEs and DEs.
            This perspective that precede the development of either logical or implantable artifacts
            and it’s a key to successful testing of implementations. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Logical Perspective</title>
          <para>Artifacts in the Logical Perspective represent traceable translations of
            Conceptual-level artifacts into a form and format, usable by and useful to architects
            and “inward-facing analysts.” Also included are additional specification materials
            required by architects preparing artifacts for consumption by developers. </para>
          <para>There are no definite boundaries between the Logical and Implementable Perspectives.
            Therefore, it’s important for organizations such as HL7 to standardize logical models
            used to generate/create implementable artifacts (i.e. implementation guides, profiles,
            and templates). CIMI clinical statements. Detailed Clinical Models, and ANF statements
            all belong in this perspective.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Implementable Perspective</title>
          <para>Artifacts in the Implementable Perspective are typically defined by developers or
            standards implementers, often through discussion with software designers, architects, or
            system integrators. Note that the artifacts in the Implementable Perspective are not
            actual implementations, but rather implementable in a number of implementation
            instances. Thus, all the necessary technical bindings, including data types, value sets,
            class libraries, and interface specifications are part of the Implementable Perspective.
            FHIR implementation requires a combination of profiles and test cases to ensure that
            implementations meet the requirements used to derive the conceptual and logical
            models.</para>

      </section>
      <section>
        <title>CIMI Models</title>
        <para>The Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) is defining a library of detailed
          clinical information models using a common modeling formalism. CIMI was established to
          improve the interoperability of healthcare information systems through shared
          implementable clinical information models that can be used to generate platform-specific
          model specifications such as FHIR profiles,CDA templates, OpenEHR Archetypes, 13606
          Archetypes, ISO DCMs, or Intermountain CEMs. These CIMI models are grouped into
          semantically equivalent (or ‘isosemantic’) families of detailed clinical models, which
          capture the same clinical meaning using different combinations of concept pre and
          post-coordination and corresponding information model structure. The central focus of the
          CIMI Reference Model is the Clinical Statement. A Clinical Statement represents structured
          electronic communication made about a patient typically documented as an 'entry' in the
          patient record. For example, Clinical Statement can be used to represent the following
          statements made about a patient. This can be the statement of a condition being present, a
          request for a procedure to be done, the results of lab tests or the patient’s family
          history of cancer. <?oxy_comment_start author="jcoyle" timestamp="20190601T180110-0500" comment="I think platform-specific is not really correct, maybe just be more generic and say something like other modeling specifications"?><?oxy_comment_end?>

        <para>"Systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, taken on the right brachial artery".</para>
        <para>For the user, the easiest way to document the measurement is in narrative text.
          However, the various parts of information about the artery, laterality, or measurement
          would require natural language processing and would be lost to any attempt of data
          retrieval. Another option to document the measurement would be to choose various parts of
          information pertinent to the blood pressure measurement and arrange them in various states
          of pre and post-coordination. </para>

        <para>Because CIMI defines several different isosemantic detailed clinical models, there is
          currently a decreased chance that modelers of clinical statements apply pre and
          post-coordinated terminology concepts and models consistently. </para>
        <para>Let's consider the same example with additional information about the blood pressure
          cuff:</para>

          blood pressure cuff”. </para>
        <para>One modeler may choose to structure this as one complex clinical statement (or a
          compound clinical statement) with various concepts and constituent expressions included
          within in it. This is also referred to as 'compositionality' in which a complex statement
          is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and rules used to combine
          them. In other words, some compound clinical statements should in fact be broken down into
          a number of simpler clinical statements to improve reproducibility of the detailed
          clinical model. </para>

    <para>Health care organizations are striving to become high reliability organizations (HROs),
      characterized by high levels of safety under inherently risky, technologically-complex, and
      demanding conditions.<citation>HRO_HIT</citation> Chassin and Loeb published a conceptual
      framework for assessing progress towards becoming a HRO and included the safe use of health IT
      and review of quality measures, which are dependent on data from Electronic Health Record
      (EHR) systems.<citation>Chassin</citation> Deployment of EHR systems is nearly ubiquitous in
      the US and there is increasing opportunity to leverage a substantial number of extant EHR
      mapped data sets to improve population health through quality measures, case reporting, and
      decision support. </para>
    <para>Information system record and manage clinical statement using a variety of standard or
      ad-hoc models. However, both treatment and analysis of clinical statements require consistency
      not only at the format level (e.g. CDA, FHIR, V2) but also the content model (i.e. an instance
      of a DCM, CIMI model, etc.). In most cases the data quality is the greatest obstacle to
      analysis, but even in the case of structured, semantically-clear information, inconsistency
      across sources of information raises obstacles to analysis and research. Analysis of aggregate
      information managed by health information networks poses the greatest challenge today because
      a meaningful use of data for patient outcomes or research requires a common format and level
      of semantic clarity.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Why ANF? </title>
    <para>Not only is there a potential for a lack of consistency with representing clinical
      statements with current detailed clinical modeling efforts, but there is also further
      variation in how the data is entered into information systems by end-users. This reality has a
      direct impact on patient safety if a clinical statement are recorded and displayed differently
      across the continuum of care: Clinicians author clinical statements and enter them into their
      organization’s EHR systems as "Structured Clinical Input". This concept describes any data
      entry mechanism used by clinicians to record clinical statements. An instance of a clinical
      statement may be created using one or more forms. Vendors compete on usability for seamless
      Structured Clinical Input but, in some cases, structured clinical statement are based on
      standard-based models (e.g. CIMI, openEHR archetypes, etc.) but they may also be based on
      proprietary models. For the purposes of this document, the type or usability of data structure
      used for capture or display of clinical statements is not in scope. We assume that <emphasis
        role="bold">any suitably encoded</emphasis> structured clinical statement may be suitable
      for normalization for analysis. </para>
    <para>Therefore, clinical statements can be expressed and documented in many different ways in
      EHR systems, where input forms provide different options to document the same clinical
      statement. These differences pose challenges for how the data is modeled, how the data is
      stored, and therefore has implications on data retrieval, data analysis,accuracy of clinical
      analysis results. </para>
    <para>Clinicians enter clinical statements into their organization’s EHR typically in a manner
      that we call here structured clinical input, or the manner in which information is presented
      to the clinicians and how they enter the data, such as by constraining the information to
      allow only certain values to be entered, e.g. through a drop-down list or radio button, or
      breaking up large chunks of related information into smaller parts.</para>
    <para>For example, a EHR could display a text field for the result and lists of choices for the
      body site:</para>
    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>Right brachial artery</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Left brachial artery</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Or it could be displayed with the site and allow further refinement to specify the
      laterality:</para>
    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>Brachial artery</para>
        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para>Right</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Left</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>In addition to specifying the body site a list of choices for the blood pressure cuff size
      used would also be selected, for example:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Adult size Small</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Adult size Medium</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Adult size Large</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The same could be true for the display and documentation option for the patient position
      (sitting yes/no, how long, urinated yes/no, how long prior to measurement), which could differ
      between systems. There are different ways the measurement result could be entered into a form
      in an EHR. Display options for the user could be, e.g. a text field to enter the measurement
      result (e.g. 120 mmHg) with the label of the complete guideline. </para>
    <para>The following is an example of two distinct user interfaces for capturing a set of
      “clinical statements" related to Blood Pressure. </para>

    <para>In the first wire frame, the structured clinical input has separate drop down constraints
      to enter the artery and laterality as distinct concepts. In the second wire frame, the
      structured clinical input has combined the artery and laterality into a compound concept. This
      variation present in the structured clinical input may also have implications on the how the
      clinical statement is modeled. </para>
    <para>Ideally,clinical information is modeled in a manner that is most efficient for use. This
      is a problem because there are many different use cases for clinical information with a wide
      range of requirements. There is no single model that can be the most efficient model for all
      the various use cases. Maximum efficiency for each use case necessitates that any particular
      clinical information be available in multiple modeled forms. These models, although different
      in form, semantically represent the same information, and are known as isosemantic models. Any
      particular detailed clinical model exists within a family of isosemantic siblings. </para>

      <title> Assumptions</title>
      <para>ANF provide precise semantic consistent data and terminology specification that are
        comparable and sharable between multiple care providers, health enterprises and
        standards-based Healthcare Information Technology (HIT). Therefore ANF has to </para>
      <para>ANF relies highly post-coordinated compositional terminologies to provide greater
        content coverage in a complete and consistent way than terminology content that is
        restricted to relying on pre-coordinated concepts. While post-coordinated compositional
        terminologies can be expressively powerful, they may generate expressions whose equivalency
        cannot be easily determined. ANF can help manage aggregate post-coordinated content in
        normalized manner with respect to the content and semantics whole the same representational
        structure as post-coordinated expressions used as input. </para>
      <para>Successful analysis requires relatively high data quality that allows system to defined
        a precise topic, category, and clear measure or result of what was observed, requested, or
        assessed during treatment. ANF can be applied to any input data, any formalism as long as
        that data semantics and terminology are sufficiently precise to define the elements
        mandatory for analysis. </para>

      <title>Intended Audience</title>
      <para> ANF is intended to support projects that aggregate clinical statements from a variety of
        sources, independent of formalism or approach used by the source system. The users of this
        specification and subsequent implementation guidance are developing solutions that support
        clinical decision support, patient safety, and research. </para>
