o	Should be written at a higher level for general understanding of the problem
o	Non-technical explanation of issues around clinical content and data analysis
o	Explain, how same piece of clinical data can be recorded in multiple different ways (CIF).
o	Start with simple examples of “Pulse” (Pulse by method, Pulse by patient status) and Blood Pressure (Systolic BP 120 mmHg, taken on right brachial artery), then go into some more complex examples
	Cite reference study about importance of patient position, micturition etc.

As above, I don’t think we want to do this so boldly, again, this is just another example of a Clinical Statement.  Cimi is all about Clinical Statements, but never once in 5 years has there been any discussion of the V3 implementation of a Clinical Statement.

I just don’t think it is a good idea to confuse HL7 members that this is some take on the existing HL7 Clinical Statement.

I think we should start off by generally defining what a clinical statement is, and then state there have been many implementations of a clinical statement, and then list these. And be careful not to use these implementations as the definition of what a clinical statement is.  We need to be careful not to confuse readers that ANF clinical statements is somehow an extension of these implementations.

This should be worded as one example/implementation of Clinical Statements, because the definition of Clinical Statements pre-dated  CDA-CMET.  Clinical Statement is a generic informatics term from the early 90’s or maybe even 80’s, not sure. But it was firmly established when we created Intermountain’s Clinical Element Model in 2001, as the Clinical Element “statement” was an implantation of a clinical statement.

We need a better term than CIF, as Classic CIMI is not CIF. Classic CIMI is as post-coordinated as is reasonable for the purpose of making queries and analysis easier.  A clinical input form is the opposite and is usually as pre-coordinated as is reasonable. During data input, these pre-coordinated instances would then need to be transformed to a post-coordinated form before being stored in a repository.

The main problem is that both ANF and highly post-coordinated models are for analysis.  ANF may be more reproducibly consistent and better for analysis, but to assert that CIMI models are designed to aid in clinical input is an error.

This should be decided sooner than later.

The big difference I see is that ANF has a pure and consistent coded topic with a numerical result, whereas Classic Cimi can have a complex structured tree of codes for parts of the topic and/or the result, where positioning in the tree may imply semantic meaning.

Maybe…

In CIMI we allow expression tree both in topic and in the value, which creates problem like the dot blot hemorrhages. We should get 1 or two examples of statements and how ANF uses it, how CIMI uses it and what it looks like in CIF. Let this emerge through worked examples. We need to explain, how ANF is different from CIMI. Need example of what “classic CIMI” is. Add to BP and Pulse example one more that has a non-numeric result." parentID="hhx_wxf_nhb" mid="9"?>

    <para>The ways in which data is entered determine, how data is stored in the EMR databases. The
        goal of ANF is to enable analysts to understand the data and how it is stored in lieu of
        having to teach them about the thousands of ways data can be entered (i.e., CIF) and ensure
        the data that has to be expressed can be expressed in an operable and scalable way. The more
        that data is normalized, the simpler it will become to analyze, and the likelihood of
        analysis errors will be reduced. Without the ANF, the probability of patient safety risks is
        increased.</para>
