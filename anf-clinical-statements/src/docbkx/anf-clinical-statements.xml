    <title>How ANF Works: ANF Clinical Statements</title>
    <para>In the context of the ANF Model, a <glossterm baseform="Clinical Statement">clinical
            statement</glossterm> represents an entry in the patient record that documents, in a
        structured/computable manner, clinical information related to the patient that is asserted
        by a particular source, recorded, and potentially verified. </para>
    <para>As seen in the <glossterm baseform="CIMI Clinical Statement">CIMI Clinical
            Statements</glossterm> section, clinical information related to the patient can be
        entered and stored in an EHR in multiple different ways. ANF strives to standardize the
        structure of clinical statements to eliminate the disparity of clinical information by
        limiting the design choices a clinical modeler must make. ANF can then act as a consistent
        transformation target for the multiple differing clinical information representations that
        currently exist, making this clinical information more easily computable and eliminating the
        need to create multiple ways to analyze the same data.</para>

Such family history is clinically relevant but is not a characteristic of the patient. I suggest to make this a 3rd type of clinical statement. If you insist on classifying statements based on what they are about, then you would have (1) statements which describe the patient as a whole, any part of him, or any entities that depend on him or his parts (qualities, realizables, processes in which he or his parts participate); (2) statements about requests for actions that once executed will results in statements of type 1 or type 3, and (3) statements about clinically relevant phenomena that occurred or have occurred in his environment but are not about the patient himself.

                        <mathphrase>For the purposes of ANF, a statement is a request or performance
                            of an action that has to be able to exist on its own. Therefore a
                            narrative would be separated into multiple clinical statements if it
                            contains multiple requests or performance of actions that could exist
                            independently of each other. For the narrative "Negative screen for PTSD
                            and depression", two separate ANF Statements would need to be created
                            and associated to each other. However, if the narrative represents two
                            or more actions that are performed as a single activity at the same time
                            without the need for stopping the action then a single topic would be
                            used. For example, "Lumbar/Thoracic Spine CT" would be represented with
                            a single topic as it represents a single activity that is performed at
                            the same time even though a Lumbar CT and a Thoracic CT could be done
                            separately.</mathphrase>

                            performed, or requested. Also, if there is some implicitness that the

                            are unrelated (Akinetic seizure without atonia) then the two statements
