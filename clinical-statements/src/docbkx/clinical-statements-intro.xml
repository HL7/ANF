o	Should be written at a higher level for general understanding of the problem
o	Non-technical explanation of issues around clinical content and data analysis
o	Explain, how same piece of clinical data can be recorded in multiple different ways (CIF).
o	Start with simple examples of “Pulse” (Pulse by method, Pulse by patient status) and Blood Pressure (Systolic BP 120 mmHg, taken on right brachial artery), then go into some more complex examples

        <title>Clinical Statement Definition</title>
        <para>In a general sense, a clinical statement is any statement about a subject of record,
            e.g. the patient, made by healthcare provider, e.g. a nurse or a physician. This can be
            the statement of a condition being present, a request for a procedure to be done, the
            results of lab tests or the patient’s family history of cancer. There are a number of
            implementations which fit this description, e.g. the current normative definition of
            Clinical Statements in HL7 V3 describes principles and constraints for Clinical
            Statements.

            </footnote></para>
        <para>Clinical Statements are used to model all “entries” in a Clinical Document Architecture(CDA)
            document section. The Clinical Statement “Common Model Element Type” (CMET) is the base
            model for the all Consolidated CDA “clinical statement” templates that are still
            mandatory for Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendors. The concept of “clinical
            statement” is widely understood though there is an issue with consistency across HL7
            paradigms: V3, CDA, and FHIR. Placeholder HERE for more detail about other paradigms
            later in the document (maybe forward link for more detail here?)</para>

        <title>Clinical Input Statements</title>
        <para>Clinical statements can be expressed and documented in many different ways in Electronic
            Medical Record (EMR) systems, where Clinical Input Forms provide different options to
            document the same clinical statement. These differences pose challenges for data retrieval,
            data analysis and data analysts in their attempts to extract accurate clinical analysis
            results. </para>
        <para>Clinicians enter clinical statements into their organization’s
            EMR<?oxy_comment_start author="kmaulden" timestamp="20190423T095907-0400" comment="Joey Coyle:
We need a better term than CIF, as Classic CIMI is not CIF. Classic CIMI is as post-coordinated as is reasonable for the purpose of making queries and analysis easier.  A clinical input form is the opposite and is usually as pre-coordinated as is reasonable. During data input, these pre-coordinated instances would then need to be transformed to a post-coordinated form before being stored in a repository.

The main problem is that both ANF and highly post-coordinated models are for analysis.  ANF may be more reproducibly consistent and better for analysis, but to assert that CIMI models are designed to aid in clinical input is an error.

This should be decided sooner than later.

The big difference I see is that ANF has a pure and consistent coded topic with a numerical result, whereas Classic Cimi can have a complex structured tree of codes for parts of the topic and/or the result, where positioning in the tree may imply semantic meaning.

Maybe…
Structured Coded Form

In CIMI we allow expression tree both in topic and in the value, which creates problem like the dot blot hemorrhages. We should get 1 or two examples of statements and how ANF uses it, how CIMI uses it and what it looks like in CIF. Let this emerge through worked examples. We need to explain, how ANF is different from CIMI. Need example of what “classic CIMI” is. Add to BP and Pulse example one more that has a non-numeric result." parentID="hhx_wxf_nhb"?>
            typically in a manner that we call here the clinical input form (CIF). However, the CIF is
            not a literal form<?oxy_comment_end?><?oxy_comment_end mid="3"?> that clinicians select and
            enter data in. Rather, it refers to the manner in which information is presented to the
            clinicians and how they enter the data, such as by constraining the information to allow
            only certain values to be entered, e.g. through a drop-down list or radio button, or
            breaking up large chunks of related information into smaller parts.</para>

                    more than 30 minutes before the measurement.</para>
                <para>There are different ways the measurement result could be entered into a form in an
                    EMR. Display options for the user could be, e.g. a text field to enter the

                <para>“Systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, taken on right brachial artery, using adult

                    urinated no more than 30 minutes prior to measurement”. For the user, this would
                    be the easiest way to document the measurement. However, the various parts of
                    information about the body site, the blood pressure cuff, patient position etc.
                    would be lost to any attempt of data retrieval.</para>

        <title>Analysis Clinical Statements</title>
        <para>The ways in which data is entered determine, how data is stored in the EMR databases. The
            goal of ANF is to enable analysts to understand the data and how it is stored in lieu of
            having to teach them about the thousands of ways data can be entered (i.e., CIF) and ensure
            the data that has to be expressed can be expressed in an operable and scalable way. The more
            that data is normalized, the simpler it will become to analyze, and the likelihood of
            analysis errors will be reduced. Without the ANF, the probability of patient safety risks is
            increased.</para>
        <para>The following chapters will discuss how the ANF Model provides the clinical data
            normalization capabilities to support accurate data retrieval and analysis.</para>
