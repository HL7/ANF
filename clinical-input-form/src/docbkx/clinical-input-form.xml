    <para>Ideally, the way the information is presented to clinicians is in a manner that is most
        efficient for the clinicians to use. However, what is an efficient way for clinicians to
        select and enter data may not be the most efficient way for data analysts to use when they
        are querying data once it has been normalized and stored in a database, such as when
        creating a new CDS rule or compiling prevalence statistics. For this, the data is normalized
        using the <emphasis role="italic">Analysis Normal Form (ANF) </emphasis>and stored in a
        database. Again, the ANF is not necessarily a physical structure, but is how a data analyst
        might see the data when they are looking at it in a database, and not as clinicians would
        see it in the user interface (i.e., CIF).</para>

    <para>ANF: Analyst creates a CDS rule to identify all patients ordered acetaminophen during
        theperiod September 1 – December 31, 2016. However, while the analyst creates a query to
        search for a clinical statement (i.e., Request) where acetaminophen was the direct substance
        and was ordered during the period September 1 – December 31, 2016, the analyst did not
        include a Request topic of “Administration of drug or medication PO BID for pain.” Thus, the
        medication order would not be included in the query
