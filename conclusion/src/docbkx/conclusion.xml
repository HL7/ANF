  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <para>In conclusion, Analysis Normal Form presents a simple reusable way to approach clinical
    statements specifically for data analysis.   It reduces clinical statements to two types,
    Performance of Action and Request for Action, both clinical statement types with topics.   ANF
    is compatible with other work in statement representation models such as the CIMI approach of
    CIF, which focuses more on how clinicians represent and enter data into electronic health record
    systems, whereas ANF focuses on structuring that data in a way for CDS systems can extract that
    data in an unambiguous way. </para>

    believe that ANF represents an approach to statement representation that needs to next be
    refined into a normative set of editorial guidelines that can eventually also be expanded upon
    into the latest standards, such as creating an HL7 FHIR Implementation
