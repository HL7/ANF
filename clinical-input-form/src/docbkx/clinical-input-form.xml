        <title>Introduction to CIMI Clinical Statements </title>
        <para> The central focus of the CIMI Reference Model is the Clinical Statement. Clinical
            Statement, shown in <xref linkend="cif_msg_cstatement_0135"/>, has a ‘key’, ‘topic’,
            ‘context’, and ‘metadata’. The ‘key’ is the terminology meaning binding for the entire
            Clinical Statement. The ‘topic’ is the clinical entity being described. The ‘context’
            describes the circumstances that form the setting in which the ‘topic’ should be
            evaluated. Finally, ‘metadata’ is the collection of metadata that is associated with the
            clinical statement: the who, where, why and when information. </para>

                    <para>The ‘topic’ is the clinical entity described by the Clinical Statement. A
                        few examples of topic include clinical assertions, evaluation results, and
                        procedures. For each of these topics the information described is quite
                        different. Therefore, CIMI describes topic types that contain the
                        appropriate attributes to describe the required information for the given
                        topic. The number of topic types will change as CIMI progresses. Currently
                        the allowable topic types are listed here. </para>

        <title>CIMI Examples</title>
        <para>The CIMI Working Group recognizes it is unlikely a one-size-fits-all approach will
            accommodate the wide variety of clinical and implementation use cases. As such, the CIMI
            architecture supports alternate representations of the same model to address the
            requirements of specific use cases. For instance, interface models may have different
            modeling requirements than persisted models or logical models. The CIMI architecture
            should thus support the definition of iso-semantic models, which are sets of
            semantically equivalent models differing primarily in their structure and terminology
            pre-coordination.</para>

        <title>CIF Issues with data retrieval</title>
        <para>Ideally, the way the information is presented to clinicians is in a manner that is
            most efficient for the clinicians to use. However, what is an efficient way for
            clinicians to select and enter data may not be the most efficient way for data analysts
            to use when they are querying data once it has been normalized and stored in a database,
            such as when creating a new CDS rule or compiling prevalence statistics. For this, the
            data is normalized using the <emphasis role="italic">Analysis Normal Form (ANF)
            </emphasis>and stored in a database. Again, the ANF is not necessarily a physical
            structure, but is how a data analyst might see the data when they are looking at it in a
            database, and not as clinicians would see it in the user interface (i.e., CIF).</para>
        <para>The more that data is normalized, the simpler it will become to analyze, and the
            likelihood of analysis errors will be reduced. The critical part of this is to ensure
            that information is not lost between the CIF and the ANF data normalization.Without the
            ANF, the probability of patient safety risks is increased. </para>

        <para>The topic patterns CIMI has developed to date include Assertion, EvaluationResult, and
            Procedure. Each of these topic subtypes contains a collection of attributes that are

                clinical value being observed. An EvaluationResult may hold the name of a test in
                the ’key’ attribute (e.g., “heart rate evaluation”, “serum glucose lab test”, etc.)
                and the resulting value of the test in the ‘result’ attribute. Viewed another way,
                the EvaluationResult ‘key’ holds a question (e.g., "what is the heart rate?", "what
                is the serum glucose?") and the ‘result’ holds the answer. Any clinical statement
                such as a laboratory test, a vital sign, or a questionnaire question that fits this
                pattern of a question and a resulting value is modeled with the EvaluationResult
                pattern. </para>

            <title>Assertion vs. Evaluation Result</title>
            <para>In most cases, the decision between using the evaluation result pattern and the
                assertion pattern is intuitive and straightforward. “Urine color”, for example, is
                clearly best modeled as an evaluation result because the property being evaluated is
                the color of the patient’s urine and the result of the evaluation is the set of
                codes representing the colors that may be observed. To model urine color as an
                assertion would require the creation of a large number of pre-coordinated concepts –
                the key would be “assertion” and result would be populated with a code from a set of
                codes such as “amber urine” (meaning “the patient has amber urine”), “clear urine”,
                etc. However, this highlights any evaluation model may be transformed into an
                assertion model. (Conversely, any assertion model may be transformed into an
                evaluation model.) In the case of urine color, the decision is intuitive. But in
                other cases, the decision is less clear.</para>
