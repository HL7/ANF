  <title>Introduction<?oxy_comment_start author="kmaulden" timestamp="20190423T093902-0400" comment="Note from Keith: For the ANF document, we should somewhere describe assumptions about what an ANF implementation requires. For example, ANF requires an ability to classify topic expressions (and expressions that may go in other locations). Maybe a section that describes the requirements of a &quot;mapping&quot; based system with a plethora of statement models, and then what ANF requires above and beyond a mapping system, and what the benefits are. 
Re-using some of the work in the interoperability paper is probably wise. I think a distillation of key concepts should be part of the HL7 ballot document. We need to motivate why an ANF approch is necessary as opposed to the status quo.

    <para>The Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) is an HL7 group that is defining a
      library of de- tailed clinical information models using a common modeling formalism. CIMI was
      established to improve the interoperability of healthcare information systems through shared
      implementable clinical information models that can be used to generate platform-specific model
      specifications such as FHIR profiles or CDA templates. These models are grouped into
      semantically equivalent (or ‘isosemantic’) families of clinical models, which capture the same
      clinical meaning using different combinations of concept pre-coordination and corresponding
      information model structure.</para>

    <para>Ideally,clinical information is modeled in a manner that is most efficient for use. This
      is a problem because there are many different use cases for clinical information with a wide
      range of requirements. There is no single model that can be the most efficient model for all
      the various use cases. Maximum efficiency for each use case necessitates that any particular
      clinical information be available in multiple modeled forms. These models, although different
      in form, semantically represent the same information, and are known as isosemantic models. Any
      particular detailed clinical model exists within a family of isosemantic siblings. </para>
    <para>Different isosemantic models can support different purposes, such as clinical data input,
      clinical data storage, clinical data querying, clinical data analysis, and modeler preference. </para>
    <para>Here, we introduce a new isosemantic representation that is designed to aid in the
      analysis of clinical information and will represent one member in each isosemantic family of
      detailed clinical models. This representation is called Analysis Normal Form (ANF).</para>
    <para>A FHIR implementation guide can eventually be developed.</para>

Is Purpose, the purpose of this document, or is it the purpose of ANF?

Depending on the above…  we could mention here that most current representations mix clinical information into the property names of the clinical data structures.  The ANF representation will have a clean separation of clinical terminology from a generic Clinical Statement data structure.

    <para>The purpose of this document is to inform the CIMI community about ANF and why it is
            needed as an additional standard isosemantic representation of models within
            CIMI.<?oxy_comment_start author="kmaulden" timestamp="20190418T105223-0400" comment="From Ioana:
I believe the ANF specification can start answer the question: how do we describe a “clinical statement” in a paradigm-neutral way to support clinical decision support and patient safety?
There are tens of examples of Clinical Statements in the Consolidated CDA specification that was adopted by all the MU-certified EHR vendors. If we could demonstrate how ANF could be used to encode those clinical statements in an implementation-neutral way and perhaps even how that ANF expression can be used migrate to FHIR, we could provide a potent business case for ANF and Solor. 
I see an opportunity to say that the ANF specification provides harmonization across HL7 paradigms and perhaps foreshadow how this ANF specification can help. A work group to address these inconsistencies was established and then merged into Orders and Observation (O&amp;O) Work Group. If we want to present this ballot to the HL7 membership at-large.
